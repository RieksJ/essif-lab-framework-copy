However, it is a common belief that if one uses a term to refer to a ",Object(n.b)(s.a,{popup:"Concept: the ideas/thoughts behind a classification of Entities (what makes Entities in that class 'the same').",reference:"/framework/docs/terms/concept",mdxType:"Term"},"concept")," in its ",Object(n.b)(s.a,{popup:"Knowledge: The (intangible) sum of what is known by a specific Party, as well as the familiarity, awareness or understanding of someone or something by that Party.",reference:"/framework/docs/terms/knowledge",mdxType:"Term"},"knowledge"),", the other will then relate it to 'the same' ",Object(n.b)(s.a,{popup:"Concept: the ideas/thoughts behind a classification of Entities (what makes Entities in that class 'the same').",reference:"/framework/docs/terms/concept",mdxType:"Term"},"concept")," within its own knowledge, that we should not assume actually exists. For example, when one of them uses the ",Object(n.b)(s.a,{popup:"Term: a word or phrase that is used in at least one Scope/context to represent a specific Concept (and referring to its Definition).",reference:"/framework/docs/terms/term",mdxType:"Term"},"term")," 'identity', it knows which ",Object(n.b)(s.a,{popup:"Concept: the ideas/thoughts behind a classification of Entities (what makes Entities in that class 'the same').",reference:"/framework/docs/terms/concept",mdxType:"Term"},"concept")," that relates to within its own ",Object(n.b)(s.a,{popup:"Knowledge: The (intangible) sum of what is known by a specific Party, as well as the familiarity, awareness or understanding of someone or something by that Party.",reference:"/framework/docs/terms/knowledge",mdxType:"Term"},"knowledge"),".

In many cases that doesn't pose a problem, because the ",Object(n.b)(s.a,{popup:"Concept: the ideas/thoughts behind a classification of Entities (what makes Entities in that class 'the same').",reference:"/framework/docs/terms/concept",mdxType:"Term"},"concepts")," of both ",Object(n.b)(s.a,{popup:"Knowledge: The (intangible) sum of what is known by a specific Party, as well as the familiarity, awareness or understanding of someone or something by that Party.",reference:"/framework/docs/terms/knowledge",mdxType:"Term"},"knowledges")," are 'sufficiently the same'.
