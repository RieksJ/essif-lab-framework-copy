## Purpose

The purpose of the eSSIF-Lab Terminology Corpus is to help people that want or need to
- understand the gist of texts about various topics (learners, CxO's);
- write texts on (a) specific topic(s) (authors);
- deeply understand texts (reviewers, domain experts);
- prevent and/or resolve misunderstandings with others working on the same/similar topics (engineers);
- make (e.g. design) decisions concerning specific topics based on solid, consistent and coherent arguments;
- create code and/or data models for automation purposes;
- etc.

We have an [introduction](terminology) that explains how we go about all this.
