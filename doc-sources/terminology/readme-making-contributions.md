Contributing to the eSSIF-Lab Terminology Corpus is primarily done by authoring, organizing and/or maintaining a set of files that serve as input to the various generators that actually produce the terminological artifacts that serve various purposes of the eSSIF-Lab. This document describes how you can do this.<sup>[1]</sup>

In order to contribute, you first need to understand the [ideas/concepts behind the terminology corpus](essifLab-pattern-terminology), i.e. 
- what %%scopes|scope%%, %%concepts|concept%%, %%terms|term%%, %%(terminological) patterns|pattern%% are, 
- the kinds of terminological artifacts such as %%glossaries|glossary%%, %%dictionaries|dictionary%%) that can be generated and
- the purposes that such artifacts intend to serve (and what makes them fit for such purposes).

## Footnotes

[1]: However, if the need were to arise for terminological artifacts that are not (yet) generated, you can contribute by [creating/modifying a generator](readme-generator-extensions) for such artifacts.
