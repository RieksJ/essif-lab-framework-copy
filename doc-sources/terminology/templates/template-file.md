<!--This template specifies the docusaurus attribtues that must be in place for the terminology-plugin to function properly. For specific generators, additional content may be required. That should be specified in the individual templates that specify the artifacts that such generators create.
The header-attributes contain the following placeholdes:
- `<scopeID>`: machine readable text that identifies the scope in which this term is defined;
- `<type>`: machine readable text that identifies the type of entity being documented/specified. Examples include `concept`, `term`, `pattern`, `glossary`, `dictionary` and new ones may be added as needed.;
- `<typeid>`: machine readable text that identifies the instance of the <type> within <existing-scope>;
