## Short Description
<!--REQUIRED--in 1-3 sentences that describe the concept to a layperson with reasonable accuracy.-->
A **scope** (in the eSSIFLab context) is the extent of the area or subject matter (as in [OED](https://www.lexico.com/definition/scope). We use it to define patterns, concepts, terms and glossaries in, but a scope may serve other (additional) purposes. Scopes may overlap, or be nested. It is comparable to [Namespeces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namespace), were it not that entities other than names (signs that are used to identify/refer to objects of various kinds) can reside in a scope as it is defined here.

## Purpose
<!--Describe why the concept is needed. What purposes does it serve? What can you do with it that you cannot do (as well) without it? What objectives does it help realize? Why is this concept relevant within its scope of definition?-->
This allows each %%term|term%% (words, phrases) to be used in a limited scope, for specific purposes. The fact that terms are 'scoped' implies that a term may have _different_ meanings, depending on the scope within which it is used. Also, it allows us to author documentation in a 'scoped' fashion, allowing different groups of people to author, use and disseminate their documentation (including documentation about their ideas (%%patterns|pattern%%), %%concepts|concept%%, and %%terms|term%%.)

## Criteria
<!--REQUIRED--How is this concept different from related ideas? What are essential characteristics that must be true? This is where you specify the [intensional definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extensional_and_intensional_definitions) of the concept, i.e. the necessary and sufficient conditions for when the term should be used. This makes that the concept becomes crystal clear. In the case of nouns, this is equivalent to specifying the properties that an object needs to have in order to be counted as a referent of the term.-->
a (virtual) demarcation that serves particular purposes.

## Examples
<!--Provide a few sentences in which you give examples that obviously qualify as instances of `Scope`, and that do NOT obviously qualify. Also, provide examples that are not (so) obvious, but help users to better understand its intension.-->

## Related Concepts
<!--Link to any concepts that are similar but distinct, with a note about the relationship.-->

## Background:
<!--Mention and link to the patterns in which this concept plays a (significant) role (possibly explaining the reason/purpose if appropriate), e.g.: -->
The %%terminology pattern|pattern-terminology%% provides an overview of how this concept fits in with related concepts.

## Use-cases
<!--This (optional) section specifies an (optional) introductory paragraph, and a level-3 (i.e. `###`) subsection for every use case it describes. Every such use-case SHOULD
- describe the situation/context of the use-case;
- show how to apply `Scope` to/in that situation;
- shows the relevance of having `Scope` for the use-case as opposed to not having it.-->

## Notes
<!--This (optional) section is the place to put anything for which there is no other good place to put it.-->
- Scopes within which a certain %%concept|concept%% is known, may still use different terms to refer to the concept. That's the reason for having %%definitions|definition%% that specify criteria for determining whether or not something qualifies as (an instance of) some concept: we cannot rely on different scopes necessarily using the same terms for that.
