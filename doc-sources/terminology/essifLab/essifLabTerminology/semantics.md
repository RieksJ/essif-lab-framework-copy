## Short Description
<!--REQUIRED--in 1-3 sentences that describe the semantics to a layperson with reasonable accuracy.-->

## Purpose
<!--Describe why the semantics is needed. What purposes does it serve? What can you do with it that you cannot do (as well) without it? What objectives does it help realize? Why is this semanticsevant within its scope of definition?-->

## Criteria
<!--REQUIRED--How is this semantics different from related ideas? What are essential characteristics that must be true? This is where you specify the [intensional definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extensional_and_intensional_definitions) of the semantics, i.e. the necessary and sufficient conditions for when the term should be used. This makes that the semanticsomes crystal clear. In the case of nouns, this is equivalent to specifying the properties that an object needs to have in order to be counted as a referent of the term.-->
