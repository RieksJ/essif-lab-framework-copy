## Short Description
<!--REQUIRED--in 1-3 sentences that describe the concept to a layperson with reasonable accuracy.-->
A **pattern** (also called **mental model** or **conceptual model**) captures a limited set of %%concepts|concept%% (ideas), relations between them, and constraints, such that together they form a coherent and consistent whole. Patterns use (tangible) %%terms|term%% to refer to these (intangible) concepts and relations, so in order to be consistent, a pattern must reside in the scope that defines these concepts and relations. A pattern may also 'connect' concepts of different scopes (preferably no more than two), which you might call an 'interconnection pattern' between these scopes. 

## Purpose
<!--Describe why the concept is needed. What purposes does it serve? What can you do with it that you cannot do (as well) without it? What objectives does it help realize? Why is this conceptevant within its scope of definition?-->
A (good) pattern can be used
- to facilitate one's thinking and reasoning about a specific subject/topic, and/or deepen one's understanding of it.
- to effectively explain backgrounds of one's reasoning/understanding of the pattern's subject.
- to efficiently discuss and improve %%definitions|definition%% of the %%concepts|concept%% and relations in the pattern.
- to write texts using precisely defined language.

## Criteria
<!--REQUIRED--How is this concept different from related ideas? What are essential characteristics that must be true? This is where you specify the [intensional definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extensional_and_intensional_definitions) of the concept, i.e. the necessary and sufficient conditions for when the term should be used. This makes that the conceptomes crystal clear. In the case of nouns, this is equivalent to specifying the properties that an object needs to have in order to be counted as a referent of the term.-->
a limited set of %%concepts|concept%% (preferably not exceeding 7+/-2)[^1], relations between such concepts, and constraints, such that together they form a coherent and consistent whole that can be used to explain one's thinking about a specific topic within a specific %%scope|scope%%.

## Examples
<!--Provide a few sentences in which you give examples that obviously qualify as instances of `Concept`, and that do NOT obviously qualify. Also, provide examples that are not (so) obvious, but help users to better understand its intension.-->

## Related Concepts
<!--Link to any %%concepts|concept%% that are similar but distinct, with a note about the relationship.-->

## Background:
The %%terminology pattern|pattern-terminology%% provides an overview of how this concept fits in with related concepts.
