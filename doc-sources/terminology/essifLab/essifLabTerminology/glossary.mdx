## Purpose
<!--State the purpose(s) that this glossary aims to fulfill, in such a way that readers can easily determine whether or not it is useful for them to use it.-->
This glossary lists the basic concepts that are needed by the various stakeholders within the eSSIF-Lab project, ranging from governance, business, process, technology etc. The idea is that it defines at least the set of concepts that are often used in these varied domains, allowing a reader with a specific background to learn how the concept is used from other (valid) perspectives that may be alien to him/her.
