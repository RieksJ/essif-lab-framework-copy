## Introduction

A [party](@), i.e. an [organization](@) or a [person](human-being@), that work to realize a specific set of [objectives](@), will not do everything themselves. For example, a [party](@) that sells products may expect another [party](@) to deliver them to its customers. Thus, a [party](@) will expect other [parties](@) to provide products or services that it can subsequently use to realize its [objectives](@). The process that provides assurance to the [party](@) that the products or services it gets are an actual contribution to the realization of its [objectives](@), is called '[governance](@)'. We use the term '[governor](governance@)' to refer to any [employees](@) of such a [party](@) that is tasked with the [governance](@) of a subset of that [party's](@) [objectives](@)[^1].

[Governance](@) is not [management](@). The latter is distinct from the first in that the latter process ensures that the [party](@) actually and efficiently realizes its [obligations](@) (i.e. [objectives](@) for which it produces the associated results itself). We use the term '[manager](management@)' to refer to any [employee](@) of such a [party](@) that is tasked with the realization of the results associated with a set of [obligation](@). For a further elaboration on this, see the [Governance and Management pattern](pattern:governance-and-management@).

This document specifies a generic process for the [governance](@) of [objectives](@) (specifically: [expectations](@)). It is characteristic of this process that it does not require its [governor](governance@) to know how the [party](@) that will be fulfilling these [expectations](@) will do so[^2]. This characteristic makes the process generically useful.

While some may see this process simply as a means to turn the [PDCA-cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDCA) (which in a way, it is), its value lies in the explicit specification of the concrete results that have to be achieved in the various steps, which lacks in most, if not all, descriptions of PDCA processes. Such explicit specifications provide the concrete basis for both the [managers](management@) of an [objective](@) and its [governors](governance@) to do their jobs.

## The Governance Process

The generic [governance](@) process consists of the following steps:

1. **(initial) [expectations](@) are set** in terms of the results/effects[^3] that have to be achieved;
2. **results/effects are measured** through so-called 'effect indicators'[^4];
3. **results/effects are judged** not only on whether or not the effect indicators have met the applicable norms[^5], but also on any circumstances (increasing insights, unexpected events, etc.) that have influenced such results;
4. **results are reflected upon**, learning from what happened and/or celebrating the results;
5. **decisions are made** about altering the [expectations](@), indicators, judgements, etc. – if necessary.

After step 5 is completed, execution continues at step 2, thus making the execution cyclic. That is possible because after completion of step 1 and completion of step 5, the same conditions apply. The following sections describe the individual steps.

### Step 1 - Setting of initial [Expectations](@)

*The purpose of this activity is to provide clarity for all stakeholders with respect to the focus of the governance process.*

It is not the purpose of this activity to come to agreement with stakeholders about what is expected of them. That would be another activity.

The results of this activity are that all of the the following criteria are met:
1. for every (focus) area that a party wants its [expectations](@) to be [governed](governance@) (e.g. finance, security, ...), a [governor](governance@) has been assigned/appointed that will develop and run the [governance](@) process for that focal area.
2. for each [expectation](@) in every focus area, a description exists that specifies the results/effects that the [expectation](@) aims for, and the [party](@)(s) that are expected to produce the results;
3. for every [expectation](@), one or more effect indicators are specified;
4. for every [expectation](@), norms that are based on such effect indicators are specified (implicitly or explicitly), as well as a point in time (that may be repetitive) that the norm must have been met;
5. the (first occurrence of the) point in time has been established by which step 5 must have been completed.
6. there is a decision by the [governor](governance@) stating that these [expectations](@) are in fact to be met and the associated results/effects are to be achieved.

### Step 2 - Measuring Results/Effects

*The purpose of this activity is to ensure that all effect indicators are being assigned values (e.g. measured).*

It is not the purpose of this activity to already pass judgements based on such values.
Having 'clean' measurements that are unprejudiced is of great value when judging achievements, and therefore measuring and judging results/effects should be distinct. In order to guarantee this distinction, it may be necessary to have third parties execute this activity.

The results of this activity are that all of the the following criteria are met:
1. all effect indicators as specified in step 1 have been assigned a value.

### Step 3 - Judging Results/Effects

*The purpose of this activity is to obtain clarity about whether or not the [expectations](@) have been achieved (in a manner that is sufficiently satisfactory to the [governor](governance@)).*

Such judgement should be based on two sources of information. The first is comparing the values of the (measured) effect indicators to the norms set in step 1c. The second source is any progressing insights, unexpected events or other circumstances that might explain any deviations (both positive and negative) from the norms. It is explicitly part of this activity to identify such circumstances.
Taking both sources of information into account, judgement must be passed on each [expectation](@); this judgement says whether or not the expected result/effect has been (sufficiently) achieved. A judgement should be justified if its indicator values deviate significantly from the norm (which can go both ways).

The results of this activity are that all of the the following criteria are met:
1. for every [expectation](@), it is clear whether or not its norm(s) have been satisfied;
2. for every [expectation](@), there is a judgement stating whether or not it is (sufficiently) achieved;
3. if, for some [expectation](@), the judgement differs from what would be expected given the evaluation of the norms, there is a justification for this judgement.

### Step 4 - Reflection/Learning

*The purpose of this activity is to provide clarity about the next steps that should be taken.*

Quite some time may elapse between setting [expectations](@), the associated effect indicators/norms, and judging the results/effects. Meanwhile, all sorts of things can change (e.g. laws, the market, political situation, competitors, technology, the [organization](@)'s obligations, etc.). Such changes may cause [expectations](@), effect indicators or norms to become outdated. The experience of having judged the results/effects in the previous step is invaluable, because the person that has done this will have 'felt' any contradiction or discrepancy between the effect indicator values and norms, and his own sense of whether the results/effects have been achieved. This information and feeling allows the [governor](governance@) (and others) to ponder, e.g. about:
– 	fine-tuning or modifying [expectations](@), indicators, norms;
– 	modifying [objectives](@) that the [organization](@) has committed itself to realize (obligations);
– 	possibilities for influencing circumstances/stakeholders;
– 	celebrating (unexpectedly) well achieved [objectives](@).

The results of this activity are that all of the the following criteria are met:
1. for every [expectation](@) it has been established what should be modified/improved and/or celebrated;
2. for every [expectation](@) there is a proposition of how this may be achieved;
3. there is either a proposition for new [expectations](@), each of which satisfies the criteria of step 1, or a statement saying there are no such [expectations](@).
4. for every new or modified [expectation](@), criteria 1

### Step 5 - Decision making

*The purpose of this activity is to explicitly decide which of the proposals in step 4 will be adopted, and which not.*

Doing so shows that you have actually learned. Also, putting all decisions in a single step allows the [governor](governance@) to delegate the work in steps 3 and 4 to others.

The results of this activity are that all of the the following criteria are met:
1. for each [expectation](@) for which it was decided (in step 1) that it should be achieved, there is a decision stating whether or not it has been shown to be the case.
2. for each proposal from step 4, there is a (preliminary) decision with respect to whether or not it will be adopted.

## Governing the Governance Process itself

Like any other process, the [governance](@) process may need to be governed. Here is how to apply the specified [governance](@) process on itself. In order to distinguish the [governance](@) process that is being governed, from the process that governs that [governance](@) process, we will refer to the latter as the meta-governance process.

Step 1 (setting the initial [expectations](@)), is as follows:
1. the meta-governance process has 5 [expectations](@) that it sets to the [governor](governance@) of the [governance](@) process. These [expectations](@) are specified by the first sentence of the description of each of the 5 activities of the [governance](@) process in the previous section;
2. for every of these [expectations](@), its effect indicator is described by the results specified after the line “The results of this activity are that all of the the following criteria are met:” of each of the 5 activities;
3. an [expectation](@) is met if all criteria as mentioned in its effect indicator are met;
4. step 5 of the process has been completed at [set a concrete time, e.g. the end of coming November].

All other steps of the [governance](@) process can be followed using the aforementioned [objectives](@), effect indicators and criteria.

## Footnotes

[^1]: Only [objectives](@) that express an [expectation](@) of its [owner](@) towards another [party](@) are subject of [governance](@). [Objectives](@) that express an [obligation](@) of its [owner](@) are [managed](management@). See the [Governance and Management pattern](pattern:governance-and-management@) for further elaboration on this.
[^2]: This does not preclude it to be used in situations where such knowledge is available.
[^3]: Example: 'Products that a customer has ordered are delivered within one working day' is an effect, whereas 'Products that a customer has ordered will be shipped immediately' is not.
[^4]: An indicator is a number or value that can be decided on (or measured) objectively by following a measuring instruction. An effect indicator measures an effect or result that is the aim of an [organization](@). Example: 'the percentage of deliveries of the last 30 days, that have been received by the customer within 24 hours after his order was accepted.'
[^5]: A norm is a level that the [organization](@) aims an indicator to comply with or must reach. Example:  [indicator] > 99%.
