This document specifies the contents of the Scope Administration file.

:::info Editor's note
The scope administration file contains whatever needs to be administered in the scope. Before documenting this, we do some experiments with SAFs to gain experience about the ways we should go about this stuff.
:::

We have an experimental SAF:
- in [JSON format](saf.json)
- in [YAML format](saf.yaml)
