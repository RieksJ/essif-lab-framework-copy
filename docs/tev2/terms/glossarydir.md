The entire section on Terminology Engine v 2 (TEv2) is still under construction.<br/>
As TEv2 is not (yet) available, the texts that specify the tool are still 'raw', i.e. not yet processed.<br/>[readers](@) will need to see through some (currently unprocessed) notational conventions.

### Summary
A **Glossarydir** is a directory within a [scopedir](@) within which the different versions of its ([machine readable](mrg@) and [human readable](hrg@)) [glossaries](@) are created and maintained.

Typically a [glossarydir](@) would contain an [MRG](@) for every version of a [terminology](@) as specified in the [scope's](@) [SAF](@). Also, it would contain one or more [HRGs](@) that are derived from any of these [MRGs](@), and perhaps the instructions for creating them as well.

The location of the [glossarydir](@) of a [scope](@) is specified in the [SAF](@) of that [scope](@) (which is located in the root of the [scopedir](@)).
