# Term-name

:::caution
The entire section on Terminology Engine v 2 (TEv2) is still under construction.<br/>
As TEv2 is not (yet) available, the texts that specify the tool are still 'raw', i.e. not yet processed.<br/>[readers](@) will need to see through some (currently unprocessed) notational conventions.

### Summary
A **Term Name** is an [identifier](@) that is used to represent a [knowledge artifact](@). Note that different [knowledge artifacts](@) can have the same [term name](@) (which is known as [semantically overloading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_overload)).

While a [term](@) is often thought of as a single word (or phrase), which is what we refer to as a [term name](@). However [terms](@) are better conceived as a construct that consists of multiple parts, enabling us to use the same [term name](@) for different kinds of [knowledge artifacts](@), as we often see that people do in practice.

The [terminology pattern](pattern-terminology-support@) provides an overview of how this concept fits in with related concepts.
The [term-ref](@) [syntax specification](/docs/tev2/spec-syntax/term-ref-syntax) specifies the syntax that [authors](@) should use as they want to use a specific [term](@) in their text.
