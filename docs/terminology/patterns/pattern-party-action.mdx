title: Pattern: Party-Action
---

This pattern captures the foundational concepts and relations that we need for thinking about people (human beings), organizations, and how they interact with one another in a decentralized, self-sovereign way - which means that each of them decides for itself whether or not to interact with others, how to conduct such interactions, etc., thereby only taking external influences into account if they want, or have some need to do so.

## Introduction
TL;DR: This pattern models that Parties (humans, organizations) perform Actions for the purpose of realizing their Objectives. Parties are not considered to actually execute such Actions; they have (human and non-human) Actors that work for them, execute such Actions, using the Party’s Knowledge as the (authoritative) guidance for executing the Actions (as well as any other relevant Knowledge they can access).

The essential characteristic of Parties is their 1-1 link with Knowledge, which they continually update and use e.g. for reasoning, decision making, and determining e.g. what to do, when, and with whom. Knowledge not only includes (observable) facts, but also opinions, e.g. regarding the Entities it knows to exist, relations between them, and rules (constraints, [logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic)[^1]) that can be used to classify and reasoning about them, and for making decisions. 

Perhaps the most important idea in this pattern is that our Party concept is not considered to (be able to) act, and they need Actors (i.e. Entities that _can_ act) to act on their behalf and thus make them perform. This does, however,  not preclude having Entities that are both Party and Actor - e.g. humans - and that such Entities can act on their ‘own’ behalf. And we can continue to use the commonly used form of speech in which a Party performs some Action, by realizing that this means that there is (at least) one Actor that is actually executing that Action.

In this pattern, Knowledge takes center stage. Knowledge contains Objectives to be realized and managed. This not only triggers all sorts of Actions to be performed, but also guides their execution in terms of when an Action should start, when it terminates, which Actors qualify for executing it, etc. Everything that is specific for a Party is reflected in its Knowledge.

This works well for human beings, which are both a Party and an Actor. So a human being can act, implying itself as an Actor, and using its personal Knowledge as guidance. The model also works when a human being (as a Party) may hire someone else (as an Actor), e.g. to fill in his tax return form. This other is guided by the Knowledge of the human being that hired him, and uses its own Knowledge for the details of filling in the tax form.

It also works well for organizations, which are typically companies, enterprises, governments or parts thereof, i.e. groups of human beings and possibly other Actors that, as a group, fit the criteria for being a Party. This group of Actors would typically work to realize the organization’s Objectives, being guided by the organization’s Knowledge (registrations, policies, etc.). Like human beings, an organization may (have an appropriate Actor) decide to hire or fire Actors for longer or shorter periods.

Parties set Objectives that they seek to achieve, the most basic of which perhaps is its mission, or its ‘raison d'être’, to the realization of which all of its actions are (ultimately) aimed. Every Objective is owned by a single Party (we do not consider ‘shared Objectives’[^2]).
