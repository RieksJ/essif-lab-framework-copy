<!--Replace 'NewConcept' with the name for the concept you want to define. Then, provide contents for the sections as you wish. You MUST provide contents for the sections 'Scope of definition', 'Short Description' and 'Criteria'-->

## Scope
<!--Short text (label, abbreviation) used to refer to the %%scope%% within which the %%concept%% is defined. The default is essifLab.-->
essifLab

Identify the (single) %%scope%% within which 'NewConcept' is used as the %%term%% to refer to the %%concept%% that this document defines. We use:

- "essiflab" to identify the %%scope%% for the basic terminology used in the [eSSIF-Lab framework](https://essif-lab.pages.grnet.gr/framework).
- "essiflabTerminology" as the %%scope%% for discussions and topics related to the creation of glossaries, concept-definitions, etc.

You may refer to any scope for which a %%scope-file%% exists.

## One-line Summary
A single sentence that describe the %%concept%% to a layperson with reasonable accuracy. This line may be used to explain `Concept` in a glossary, or as a popover text when it is referred to in other documentation.

For example: "A warm-blooded animal, often having fur or hair, that produces milk to feed its young."

## Short Description
in 1-3 sentences that describe the %%concept%% to a layperson with reasonable accuracy.

For example, the concept of a "mammal" in biology might be described as: "A warm-blooded animal, often having fur or hair, that produces milk to feed its young. Examples include rats, whales, and bats." A diagram could be included, if appropriate. The goal here is not perfect clarity; that's the focus of the 'Criteria' section.

## Purpose
Describe why the %%concept%% is needed. What purposes does it serve? What can you do with it that you cannot do (as well) without it? What objectives does it help realize? Why is this %%concept%% relevant within its %%scope%% of definition?

## Criteria
How is this %%concept%% different from related ideas? What are essential characteristics that must be true? This is where you specify the [intensional definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extensional_and_intensional_definitions) of the %%concept%%, i.e. the necessary and sufficient conditions for when the term should be used. This makes that the %%concept%% becomes crystal clear. In the case of nouns, this is equivalent to specifying the properties that an object needs to have in order to be counted as a referent of the term.

a vertibrate that has mammary glands, a neocortex in the brain and 3 middle ear bones.

## Examples
Provide a few sentences in which you give examples that obviously qualify as instances of NewTerm, and that do NOT obviously qualify. Also, provide examples that are not (so) obvious, but help users to better understand its intension.

Primates (humans, monkeys), rodents (mice, rats), bats, and others qualify. Birds and reptiles do not (they lack mammary glands). [Platypus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platypus)[^1] is also a mammal, even though it lays eggs.

## Related Concepts
Link to any %%concepts:concept%% that are similar but distinct, with a note about the relationship. For example:

* %%offspring (of a mammal):offspring%% is the set of %%mammals:mammal%% that are born from that mammal.
* %%mate (of a mammal):mate%% is any %%mammal%% of the same species with which the %%mammal%% has created %%ofspring%%.

## Domains
In which general knowledge ecosystems or mental model families does this %%concept%% play a role? For example:

* Biology

## Tags
Add hash tags here that allow us to group concepts in useful ways.

## Use-cases
<!--This (optional) section specifies an (optional) introductory paragraph, and a level-3 (i.e. `###`) subsection for every use case it describes. Every such use-case SHOULD
- describe the situation/context of the use-case;
- show how to apply `NewTerm` to/in that situation;
- shows the relevance of having `NewTerm` for the use-case as opposed to not having it.

## Notes
<!--This (optional) section is the place to put anything for which there is no other good place to put it.
