<!--A concept tries to capture the idea behind a classification of entities, allowing us to reason about everything in the class as if it were one thing. This file specifies the idea(s) that, within the scope of `<ExistingScopeID>` will be referred to using <New Term>.
Please fill in the placeholders in this file as follows:
- `<ExistingScopeID>`: identifier of the scope in which the term is defined;
- `<Existing Scope>`: human readable text that identifies the scope in which this item is defined;
- `<NewTerm>`: term that will identify the concept within <ExisingScopeID>;
- `<ExistingTerm>`: term by which the concept is concept is known in that scope

## One-line Summary
A single sentence that describe the concept to a layperson with reasonable accuracy. This line may be used to explain `Concept` in a glossary, or as a popover text when it is referred to in other documentation.

For example: "A warm-blooded animal, often having fur or hair, that produces milk to feed its young."

## Short Description
in 1-3 sentences that describe the concept to a layperson with reasonable accuracy.

For example, the concept of a "mammal" in biology might be described as: "A warm-blooded animal, often having fur or hair, that produces milk to feed its young. Examples include rats, whales, and bats." A diagram could be included, if appropriate. The goal here is not perfect clarity; that's the focus of the 'Criteria' section.

## Purpose
Describe why the concept is needed. What purposes does it serve? What can you do with it that you cannot do (as well) without it? What objectives does it help realize? Why is this concept relevant within its scope of definition?

## Criteria
How is this concept different from related ideas? What are essential characteristics that must be true? This is where you specify the [intensional definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extensional_and_intensional_definitions) of the concept, i.e. the necessary and sufficient conditions for when the term should be used. This makes that the concept becomes crystal clear. In the case of nouns, this is equivalent to specifying the properties that an object needs to have in order to be counted as a referent of the term.

a vertibrate that has mammary glands, a neocortex in the brain and 3 middle ear bones.

## Examples
Provide a few sentences in which you give examples that obviously qualify as instances of NewTerm, and that do NOT obviously qualify. Also, provide examples that are not (so) obvious, but help users to better understand its intension.

Primates (humans, monkeys), rodents (mice, rats), bats, and others qualify. Birds and reptiles do not (they lack mammary glands). [Platypus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platypus)[^1] is also a mammal, even though it lays eggs.

## Related Concepts
Link to any concepts that are similar but distinct, with a note about the relationship. For example:

* offspring (of a mammal) is the set of mammals that are born from that mammal.
* mate (of a mammal) is any mammal of the same species with which the mammal has created ofspring.

## Domains
In which general knowledge ecosystems or mental model families does this concept play a role? For example:

* Biology

## Tags
Add hash tags here that allow us to group concepts in useful ways.

## Use-cases
<!--This (optional) section specifies an (optional) introductory paragraph, and a level-3 (i.e. `###`) subsection for every use case it describes. Every such use-case SHOULD
- describe the situation/context of the use-case;
- show how to apply `NewTerm` to/in that situation;
- shows the relevance of having `NewTerm` for the use-case as opposed to not having it. -->

## Notes
<!--This (optional) section is the place to put anything for which there is no other good place to put it. -->
