<!--A %%pattern%% captures a set of %%concepts:concept%%, relations between them, and rules or constraints that (instances) thereof comply with. As such, it is a concise and possibly formal description of a coherent set of ideas, a mental model if you will, that can be used to facilitate one's thinking about/with these concepts.
This file documents a pattern called `<NewPattern>` within the scope of `<ExistingScope>`.
Before completing this template, please change every instance of 
- `<ExistingScope>` into a text that refers to the %%scope%% within which the %%pattern%% is to be defiend;

Then, provide contents for the sections as you wish. You MUST provide contents for the sections 'Scope' and 'Criteria'-->
