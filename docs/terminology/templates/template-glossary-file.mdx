<!--A %%glossary%% is a list of %%terms:term%% with (short) explanations, usually aimed to help people understand texts around a certain (set of) topic(s) in some context(s).-->

## Scope
<!-- *REQUIRED* Short text (label, abbreviation) used to refer to the %%scope%% within which the %%glossary%% is defined. The default is essifLab.-->
essifLab

## Purpose
<!--State the purpose(s) that this glossary aims to fulfill, in such a way that readers can easily determine whether or not it is useful for them to use it.-->

## Sources
<!--This section specifies the sources from which the glossary entries (and their descriptions) are to be collected. All terms from all sources are included in the glossary. If that is too much, then you should revert to stating individual terms, patterns or concepts (see below).-->

### Terms
<!--Specify the %%term-files:term-file%% that are to be included in this glossary. If a term is defined in a scope as well as in a %%term-file%%, then both are included in the glossary (where the scope identifier is used to distinguish between them). -->

### Concepts
<!--Specify the %%concept-files:concept-file%% that are to serve as a source for this glossary. If a term is defined in a scope, or as a term, or in a pattern as well as in a %%concept-file%%, the latter takes precedence.-->

### Patterns
<!--Specify the %%pattern-files:pattern-file%% that are to serve as a source for this glossary. If a term is defined in a scope or as a term as well as in a %%pattern-file%%, then both are included in the glossary (where the scope identifier is used to distinguish between them).-->

### Glossaries
<!--Specify the %%glossary-files:glossary-file%% all %%term%%s of which are to be included in this glossary.-->
