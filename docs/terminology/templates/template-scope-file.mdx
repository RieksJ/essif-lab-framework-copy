<!--A %%scope%% is something within which %%concepts:concept%% can be associated with %%terms:term%%, thereby creating a vocabulary that can be used to meaningfully express ideas, arguments, etc.-->

## Scope
<!-- *REQUIRED* Short text (label, abbreviation) that can be used to refer to the scope. Scope identifiers/labels should be useable as prefix for terms, thus providing a mechanism to refer to terms defined in other scopes, and therefore should consist of lower-case characters [a-z0-9], preferably without `-` or `_` characters. For eSSIF-Lab, we use `essifLab`.-->

## Governance
<!--This section identifies the %%organizational body:Jurisdiction%% that governs the %%scope%%. Optionally, a reference to the governance framework/procedures may be made.-->

## Objectives/Issues
<!--State the purpose for having the scope in terms of objectives that are aimed for and/or issues that are to be addressed.-->

## Scope URI
<!--Optionally specify the URI by which this scope may be identified-->

## Inclusions
<!--This %%scope%% may include other scopes, which means that everything in that other scope is also considered part of this %%scope%%. In case of collisions, this %%scope%% MUST provide a means to resolve such conflicts without modifying anything in included scopes. For eSSIF-Lab, we include `essifLabTerminology`-->

## Notes
<!--Anything els that's worth mentioning.-->

## Tags
<!--Add hash tags here that allow us to group concepts in useful ways.-->
