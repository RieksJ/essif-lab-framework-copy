## Governance
<!--This (required) section identifies the organizational body that governs the scope in which the glossary is needed. Optionally, a reference to the governance framework/procedures may be made.-->

"[eSSIF-Lab project](https://essif-lab.pages.grnet.gr/framework/docs/terminology)"


## Objectives/Issues
<!--State the issues, the identification and addressing is being considered and treated within the scope, and
the objectives, the realization of which is the reason for the scope's existence (note that a mission statement may be one of these objectives).-->

People have different backgrounds, cultures, etc. that can make it difficult to understand what others mean, even if they use the same vocabulary. This glossary lists the terms that are needed to establish a mechanism that allows people to overcome such difficulties.

## Scope identification
<!--State a short text or abbreviation that can be used within eSSIF-Lab (or beyond) to refer to the scope.
Optionally, a URI may be specified if global identification is required.
Scope identifiers/labels should be useable as prefix for terms, thus providing a mechanism to refer to terms defined in other scopes-->
