## Governance
<!--This (required) section identifies the organizational body that governs the scope in which the glossary is needed. Optionally, a reference to the governance framework/procedures may be made.-->

"[eSSIF-Lab project](https://essif-lab.pages.grnet.gr/framework/docs/terminology)"


## Objectives/Issues
<!--State the issues, the identification and addressing is being considered and treated within the scope, and
the objectives, the realization of which is the reason for the scope's existence (note that a mission statement may be one of these objectives).-->

This glossary lists the basic concepts that are needed by the various stakeholders within the eSSIF-Lab project, ranging from governance, business, process, technology etc. The idea is that it defines at least the set of concepts that are often used in these varied domains, allowing a reader with a specific background to learn how the concept is used from other (valid) perspectives that may be alien to him/her.

## Scope identification
<!--State a short text or abbreviation that can be used within eSSIF-Lab (or beyond) to refer to the scope.
Optionally, a URI may be specified if global identification is required.
Scope identifiers/labels should be useable as prefix for terms, thus providing a mechanism to refer to terms defined in other scopes-->
