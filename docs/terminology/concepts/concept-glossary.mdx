## Scope
eSSIF-Lab Terminology

## Summary
in 1-3 sentences the concept to a layperson with reaonable accuracy

## Scope of definition
Identify a (single) scope within which the concept is to be defined. The scope you identify SHOULD have a Scope Description, or you should make one. `eSSIF-Lab` is the 'universal' scope, `Terminology` is the scope for discussions and topics related to the creation of glossaries, concept-definitions, etc.

* (scope identifier)

## Criterion
<!--This (required) section specifies the [intensional definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extensional_and_intensional_definitions#Intensional_definition) definition of `Glossary`, which is a specification of the  necessary and sufficient conditions for when Glossary should be used. In other words: you specify a criterion that readers can use to determine whether or not something is an instance of Glossary.-->
an alphabetical list of words with (short) explanations, that exists for the purpose of helping people to get a first understanding of the meaning of these words in at least one specific context.

## Examples
<!--This (optional) section contains examples, both of what satisfies the definition (and hence qualifies as an instance of Glossary), ans what does not. If you can think of examples for which the criterion may not (always) work, then describe them, too, and inform the reader why this hasn't affected the definition (yet) - e.g. because such cases are irrelevant to the scope within which the term is defined.-->
Examples include the [eSSIF-Lab Glossary](essif-lab-glossary), the [Sovrin Glossary](https://sovrin.org/library/glossary/), the [Glossary of Internet Terms](https://www.internetsociety.org/internet/glossary-internet-terms/), the glossary of the [NIST Computer Security Resource Center](https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary), and glossaries for Legal Terms, e.g. of the [US](https://www.uscourts.gov/glossary), [Singapore](https://www.supremecourt.gov.sg/services/self-help-services/glossary-of-terms), the [UK](https://www.copfs.gov.uk/involved-in-a-case/glossary-of-legal-terms).

<!--## Summary
This (optional) section summarizes the backgrounds of the chosen definition/criterion. It is the TL;DR version of the `Description` section. Apart from serving its own purposes, this section may serve the purposes that a `Description` section would have served if it hadn't been omitted.-->

<!--## Description
This (optional) section explains the backgrounds of the chosen definition/criterion. It may contain links to media (diagrams, audio, video). It SHOULD contain links to all patterns that use this concept.-->

<!--## Related Concepts from other terminologies
This (optional) section lists words/phrases that are encountered in other contexts that have the same or a sufficiently similar meaning as Glossary. In this section you may point out the (subtle) differences between Glossary and this related terminology. This helps readers better/deeper understand Glossary, and how it may be used to relate to existing texts. Ideally, such references are accompanied with links to (preferredly authoritative) sources.-->
- Dictionary - this is more extensive; it may include e.g. information on pronunciation, etymology, usage, example sentences,synonyms, etc. See [askdifference.com](https://www.askdifference.com/dictionary-vs-glossary/)
- Vocabulary - this is a body of words used in a particular language or field of expertise. A Glossary can (alphabetically) list such words.

<!--## Use-cases
This (optional) section specifies an (optional) introductory paragraph, and a level-3 (i.e. `###`) subsection for every use case it describes. Every such use-case SHOULD
- describe the situation/context of the use-case;
- show how to apply `Glossary` to/in that situation;
- shows the relevance of having `Glossary` for the use-case as opposed to not having it.-->

<!--## Notes
This (optional) section is the place to put anything for which there is no other good place to put it.-->
The [eSSIF-Lab Glossary](essif-lab-glossary) contains the words that are defined within the scope of the [eSSIF-Lab framework](introduction).
