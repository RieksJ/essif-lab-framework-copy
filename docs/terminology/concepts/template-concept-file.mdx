<!--Replace 'NewConcept' with the name for the concept you want to define. Then, provide contents for the sections as you wish. You MUST provide contents for the sections 'Scope of definition', 'Short Description' and 'Criteria'-->

## Scope
eSSIF-Lab

## One-line Summary
<!--A single sentence that describe the {{concept}} to a layperson with reaonable accuracy. This line may be used to explain `Concept` in a glossary, or as a popover text when it is referred to in other documentation.-->

## Short Description
<!--in 1-3 sentences that describe the {{concept}} to a layperson with reaonable accuracy.-->

## Purpose
<!--Describe why the {{concept}} is needed. What purposes does it serve? What can you do with it that you cannot do (as well) without it? What objectives does it help realize? Why is this {{concept}} relevant within its {{scope}} of definition?-->

## Criteria
<!--How is this {{concept}} different from related ideas? What are essential characteristics that must be true? This is where you specify the [intensional definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extensional_and_intensional_definitions) of the {{concept}}, i.e. the necessary and sufficient conditions for when the term should be used. This makes that the {{concept}} becomes crystal clear. In the case of nouns, this is equivalent to specifying the properties that an object needs to have in order to be counted as a referent of the term.-->

## Examples
<!--Provide a few sentences in which you give examples that obviously qualify as instances of NewTerm, and that do NOT obviously qualify. Also, provide examples that are not (so) obvious, but help users to better understand its intension.-->

## Related Concepts
<!--Link to any {{concepts|concept}} that are similar but distinct, with a note about the relationship.-->

## Domains
<!--In which general knowledge ecosystems or mental model families does this {{concept}} play a role?-->

## Tags
<!--Add hash tags here that allow us to group concepts in useful ways.-->

## Use-cases
<!--This (optional) section specifies an (optional) introductory paragraph, and a level-3 (i.e. `###`) subsection for every use case it describes. Every such use-case SHOULD
- describe the situation/context of the use-case;
- show how to apply `NewTerm` to/in that situation;
- shows the relevance of having `NewTerm` for the use-case as opposed to not having it.-->
