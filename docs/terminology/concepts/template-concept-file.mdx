## Criterion
<!--This (required) section specifies the [intensional definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extensional_and_intensional_definitions#Intensional_definition) definition of `NewTerm`, which is a specification of the  necessary and sufficient conditions for when NewTerm should be used. In other words: you specify a criterion that readers can use to determine whether or not something is an instance of NewTerm.-->

<!--## Examples
This (optional) section contains examples, both of what satisfies the definition (and hence qualifies as an instance of NewTerm), ans what does not. If you can think of examples for which the criterion may not (always) work, then describe them, too, and inform the reader why this hasn't affected the definition (yet) - e.g. because such cases are irrelevant to the scope within which the concept is defined.-->

<!--## Summary
This (optional) section summarizes the backgrounds of the chosen definition/criterion. It is the TL;DR version of the `Description` section. Apart from serving its own purposes, this section may serve the purposes that a `Description` section would have served if it hadn't been omitted.-->

<!--## Description
This (optional) section explains the backgrounds of the chosen definition/criterion. It may contain links to media (diagrams, audio, video). It SHOULD contain links to all patterns that use this concept.-->

<!--## Related Concepts from other terminologies
This (optional) section lists words/phrases that are encountered in other contexts that have the same or a sufficiently similar meaning as NewTerm. In this section you may point out the (subtle) differences between NewTerm and this related terminology. This helps readers better/deeper understand NewTerm, and how it may be used to relate to existing texts. Ideally, such references are accompanied with links to (preferredly authoritative) sources.-->

<!--## Use-cases
This (optional) section specifies an (optional) introductory paragraph, and a level-3 (i.e. `###`) subsection for every use case it describes. Every such use-case SHOULD
- describe the situation/context of the use-case;
- show how to apply `NewTerm` to/in that situation;
- shows the relevance of having `NewTerm` for the use-case as opposed to not having it.-->

<!--## Notes
This (optional) section is the place to put anything for which there is no other good place to put it.-->

DefScope = eSSIF-Lab <!--this is a required line, that specifies an identifier for the scope into which the concept is being defined.-->
