## Criterion
<!--This (required) section specifies the [intensional definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extensional_and_intensional_definitions#Intensional_definition) definition of `Term`, which is a specification of the  necessary and sufficient conditions for when the term should be used. In other words: you specify a criterion that readers can use to determine whether or not something is an instance of the term.-->

## Examples
<!--This (optional) section contains examples, both of what satisfies the definition (and hence qualifies as an instance of the Term), ans what does not. If you can think of examples for which the criterion may not (always) work, then describe them, too, and inform the reader why this hasn't affected the definition (yet) - e.g. because such cases are irrelevant to the scope within which the term is defined.-->

## Summary
<!--This (optional) section summarizes the backgrounds of the chosen definition/criterion. It is the TL;DR version of the `Description` section. Apart from serving its own purposes, this section may serve the purposes that a `Description` section would have served if it hadn't been omitted.-->

## Description
<!--This (optional) section explains the backgrounds of the chosen definition/criterion. It may contain links to media (diagrams, audio, video). It SHOULD contain links to all patterns that use this concept.-->

## Related Concepts from other terminologies
<!--This (optional) section lists words/phrases that are encountered in other contexts that have the same or a sufficiently similar meaning that this is worth noting, to help readers distinguish between them. Ideally, such references are accompanied with links to (preferredly authoritative) sources.-->

## Use-cases
<!--This (optional) section specifies an (optional) introductory paragraph, and a level-3 (i.e. `###`) subsection for every use case it describes. Every such use-case SHOULD
- describe the situation/context of the use-case
- show how to apply the term to the situation
- shows the relevance of having the term for the use-case as opposed to not having the term -->

## Notes
<!--This (optional) section is the place to put anything for which there is no other good place to put it.-->

## Footnotes
<!--This (optional) section contains any footnotes that may have been specified in the text above.-->

## Meta
<!--This (optional) section specifies attributes that are needed for generating/adapting other documents, such as glossaries, term-files, etc.-->

DefScope = eSSIF-Lab <!--this is an identifier for the scope into which the term is being defined.-->
