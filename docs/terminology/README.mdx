# README for the Concepts and Terminology work

This directory contains the artefacts that can be used 
to generate Pages that explain concepts and terms, 
as well for generating a Glossary.

These artefacts are expected to provide a rigorous underpinning of the decisions 
that have led to the specification of the semantics of the various terms.
