The backlog of the eSSIF-Lab Framework is a list of issues (concerns, topics) that still need to be addressed in the framework. This seems a more user-friendly way than maintaining them as [github issues](https://github.com/essif-lab/framework/issues), which obviously is a valid way for people to contribute to the framework as well.
