# Terminology Design

In order for a [community](@) (e.g. a workgroup, taskforce, project/product team, department, etc.) to realize its [objectives](@), it is beneficial that its members have a common set of the ideas, [concepts](@) and other [knowledge artifacts](@) that are relevant for realizing these [objectives](@). The ability to realize such a common understanding, and to demonstrate that this is actually the case, is a critical capability for success.

## The importance of establishing 'linguistic unity'

[Many cultures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Babel#Comparable_myths) have stories, similar to that of the [Tower of Babel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Babel), that observe that the big feats, such as building a "tower, whose top may reach unto heaven", cannot be achieved unless there is a sufficient 'linguistic unity' between people that work together to produce a result that contributes to the construction of the tower. That is: the [terms](@) they use have (sufficiently) the same meaning. Or in still other words: to have a [terminology](@), i.e. a set of [terms](@), that all participants have the same understanding of, and find relevant for the context in which they work together.

All of these stories suggest that this is far from trivial. And the fact that the architecture of the building of the EU parliament in Strasboug very much resembles the Tower of Babel as painted by Brueghel (see Figure 1), is a constant reminder of this.

## The difficulty of establishing a terminology

Many people that have been part of project teams that engage in large projects have experienced this in person, and can tell many stories about how gaining a workable 'linguistic unity' wasn't really achieved in some project, even though project memebers all agreed on how important this is, and real attempts were made to realize it.

The most common approach for this is to create a glossary, i.e. an alphabetically sorted list of terms and their descriptions (sometimes also called definitions), that the participants in a project all agree on. Usually, this means that people start to collect terms and descriptions that they either make up, or copy from other existing glossaries. Then, discussions follow that typically result in the modification of descriptions, as well as in more discussions. At some point, the effort needs to stop, and the glossary is established (published, finalized).

A glossary that has been created this way typically does not establish the 'linguistic unity' that was attempted to be realized. If it had, you would not find documents (articles, blogs, mailing list messages, github issues, etc.) that used a term in a meaning that differs from the meaning as defined in the glossary they supposedly use. Also, you would not see discussions between people that each use a specific term in their own way, i.e. in a meaning that differs from that of the other persons.

:::info Editor's note
We need some additional text here that on the one hand acknowledges the genuine efforts of people to achieve 'linguistic unity', and explains why these efforts so seldomly result in the intended effects.

Also, perhaps, some texts that comment on the quality (i.e.: usefulness) of definitions, e.g.:
- terms that are defined in terms of themselves;
- terms that are followed by a description of which it is unclear how that defines a term;
- terms that are specified as a criterion so that people can determine what is (not) an instance (example) of the term;
- terms that are specified such that, when a sentence mentions a term, and the term is replaced with its definition, the sentence is still grammatically correct and meaningful.
