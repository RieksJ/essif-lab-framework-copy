# On the Design of Terminology

In order for a [community](@) (e.g. a workgroup, taskforce, project/product team, department, etc.) to realize its [objectives](@), it is beneficial that its members have a common set of the ideas, [concepts](@) and other [knowledge artifacts](@)[^1] that are relevant for realizing these [objectives](@), and also that they use the same [terms](@) to represent them.

[^1]: ideas, [concepts](@) and other [knowledge artifacts](@) are (intangible) parts of a [knowledge](@). One could say that they constitute 'the mind' of [parties](@). They need a (tangible) representation, e.g. [terms](@), figures, sounds, etc. that [parties](@) can use to communicate with each other. The problem is that each participant of a [community](@) must be sufficiently sure that not only they all use the same [terms](@), but also that they have a common understanding of the actual [concept](@) that an individual [term](@) represents.

Other contexts exist, in which actively pursuing a common set of ideas is not beneficial. , or may even be counterproductive.   In other contexts, e.g. where people are talking their hobby, or interacting with one another to
Thus,  create and maintain a [terminology](@) that they use for their purposes. e ability to realize such a common understanding, and to demonstrate that this is actually the case, is a critical capability for success.[^2]

[^2]: While the importance, and even the meaning of 'common understanding' can vary, our focus lies on the contexts mentioned in this paragraph, i.e. those in which a group of people pursue (the realization of) a set of [objectives](@).

[TL;DR](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=tl%3Bdr): In the subsequent sections we will:
- illustrate the importance of realizing a common understanding,
- elaborate on the difficulties that people encounter as they try to do so,
- propose a new approach that aims to overcome such difficulties and realize a provable common understanding.

## The importance of establishing 'linguistic unity'

[Many cultures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Babel#Comparable_myths) have stories, similar to that of the [Tower of Babel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Babel), that observe that the big feats, such as building a "tower, whose top may reach unto heaven", cannot be achieved unless there is a sufficient 'linguistic unity' between people that work together to produce a result that contributes to the construction of the tower. That is: the [terms](@) they use have (sufficiently) the same meaning. Or in still other words: to have a [terminology](@), i.e. a set of [terms](@), that all participants have the same understanding of, and find relevant for the context in which they work together.

Without linguistic unity, it is hard - if not impossible, to work together and reach a common goal, or to interoperate. For example, if two railway companies have different ideas about what the width of a railroad track is ([track gauge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_gauge)), their trains cannot run on each other's tracks.

The architecture of the building of the EU parliament in Strasboug intentionally resembles the Tower of Babel as painted by Brueghel (see Figure 1), as a constant reminder to members and non-members of that parliament that understanding one another is at the basis of any cooperation.

## The difficulty of establishing a terminology

Many people that have been part of project teams that engage in large projects have experienced this in person, and can tell many stories about how gaining a workable 'linguistic unity' wasn't really achieved in some project, even though project memebers all agreed on how important this is, and real attempts were made to realize it.

The most common approach for this is to create a glossary, i.e. an alphabetically sorted list of terms and their descriptions (sometimes also called definitions), that the participants in a project all agree on. Usually, this means that people start to collect terms and descriptions that they either make up, or copy from other existing glossaries. Then, discussions follow that typically result in the modification of descriptions, as well as in more discussions. At some point, the effort needs to stop, and the glossary is established (published, finalized).

A glossary that has been created this way typically does not establish the 'linguistic unity' that was attempted to be realized. If it had, you would not find documents (articles, blogs, mailing list messages, github issues, etc.) that used a term in a meaning that differs from the meaning as defined in the glossary they supposedly use. Also, you would not see discussions between people that each use a specific term in their own way, i.e. in a meaning that differs from that of the other persons.

:::info Editor's note
We need some additional text here that on the one hand acknowledges the genuine efforts of people to achieve 'linguistic unity', and explains why these efforts so seldomly result in the intended effects.

Also, perhaps, some texts that comment on the quality (i.e.: usefulness) of definitions, e.g.:
- terms that are defined in terms of themselves;
- terms that are followed by a description of which it is unclear how that defines a term;
- terms that are specified as a criterion so that people can determine what is (not) an instance (example) of the term;
- terms that are specified such that, when a sentence mentions a term, and the term is replaced with its definition, the sentence is still grammatically correct and meaningful.
