I have a set of python scripts that work in the context of a particular directory in a git repo, which I call the 'scopedir'. The scripts are run in the scopedir. The scopedir contains a scope administration file (a SAF), which is a yaml file that has three sections, called `scope`, `scopes`, and `versions` respectively, each with particular dictionaries/fields that I will identify as needed. 

Somewhere within the scopedir, there is 
- a directory that contains glossary-related files. This directory is called the 'glossarydir'.
- a directory that contains so called curated texts or ctexts, which are contained in markdown files. The directory is called the 'cureatedir' The markdown files contain yaml frontmatter.

The scripts generate a machine-readable glossary (mrg) from the markdown files in the cureatedir. The mrg has three sections, called `terminology`, `scopes`, and `entries`.  For every section, I have a script that creates its contents, called `mrgen_terminology.py`, `mrgen_scopes.py` and `mrgen_entries.py` resepctively. The results produced (the sections) are concatenated and written as yaml in the main script (called 'mrgen.py'). 

I want you to work with me to add or modify some features to the contents of these files.


in the mrgen_entries script, the fields `scopetag`, `locator` and `navurl` are given values in expressions that  use the placeholders `<scopetag>`, `<locator>` and `<navurl>` respectively, which need to be modified, as follows:
- the `locator` value
