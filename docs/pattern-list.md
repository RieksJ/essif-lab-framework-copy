Within eSSIF-Lab, we maintain a set of %%mental models|mental-model%%, i.e. casual and formal descriptions (patterns) of %%concepts|concept%%, relations between them, and constraints, that provide a specific 'viewpoint', or 'way of thinking' about a certain topic. 

:::info Editor's note
While some of the topics listed below are pretty much done, others are still need more work.
:::

We currently have models for the following topics:

- [Duties and Rights](./terms/pattern-duties-and-rights): The Duties and Rights pattern describes the relations between %%jurisdictions|jurisdiction%%, %%legal entities|legal-entity%% and the duties and rights they have within them.

- [Guardianship relationships](./terms/pattern-guardianship): The Guardianships pattern captures the %%concepts|concept%% and relations that explain what a generic %%guardianship|guardianship%% consists of, and how it relates to %%guardians|guardian%%, %%dependents|dependent%%, %%jurisdictions|jurisdiction%%, etc.

- [Jurisdictions](./terms/pattern-jurisdiction): The Jurisdictions pattern captures the %%concepts|concept%% and relations that explain what a generic %%jurisdiction|jurisdiction%% consists of, and relates it to %%parties|party%% and %%legal entities|legal-entity%%.

- [Mandates, Delegation and Hiring](./terms/pattern-mandates-delegation-hiring): The Mandates, Delegation and Hiring pattern (which remains to be documented) captures the ideas behind Mandating, Delegating, Hiring and their relations. This is a work-in-progress.

- [Parties, Actors and Actions](./terms/pattern-party-actor-action): The %%Parties|party%%, %%Actors|actor%% and %%Actions|action%% pattern captures the foundational %%concepts|concept%% and relations that we need for thinking about how things get done. It answers questions such as: 'Who/what does things?', 'How are their actions being guided/controlled?', 'Who controls whom/what?', 'Who/what may be held accountable?'.

- [Terminology:](./terms/pattern-terminology): The eSSIF-Lab Terminology Pattern describes the relations between %%terminology|terminology%% artifacts such as '%%concept|concept%%', '%%term|term%%', '%%pattern|pattern%%', '%%mental model|mental-model%%', '%%glossary|glossary%%' etc.
