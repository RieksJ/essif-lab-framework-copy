### Short Description
**Trust** (of a %%party|party%% in X) is the (subjective) degree of belief or confidence that this %%party|party%% has in X. X can be anyone or anything. One can trust a president to a certain extent to make the right decisions. One may trust one's own judgements or conscience to a very high degree.

The degree of belief or confidence is a subjective judgement or perception by a %%party|party%%. So, given the same exact circumstances, two %%parties|party%% will perceive different levels of trust based e.g.on their %%risk|risk%% tolerance and history with trust issues.

Trust is not something that is given, but something that %%parties|party%% (un)consciously assess, and decide about, and changes over time. Since parties are autonomous, their trust is highly subjective. As a consequence, the idea of having 'trusted registries', 'trusted issuers' that do not take this subjectivity into account basically act as %%(centralized) authorities|authority%%, denying that parties are autonomous. While we acknowledge that such ideas (have a right to) exist, we do not follow them.

So trust has a few basic issues, in that it is often not clear
- who the actual party is in which the belief or confidence is rooted.
- what X is - what it is that the party believes, o confides in.
