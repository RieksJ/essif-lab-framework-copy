### Short Description
A **trust level** is a (subjective) degree of belief or confidence that a %%party|party%% has in (the truth of) X, where X is an arbitrary %%statement|assertion%% that can be true or false. For example, the degree of belief you have in that the president of the US makes the right decisions is the %%trust level|trust-level%% associated with you (as a %%party|party%%), and the %%assertion|assertion%% "the president of the US makes the right decisions".

%%trust levels|trust-level%% are subjective judgements made by individual %%parties|party%%. Given the same exact circumstances, two %%parties|party%% will perceive different levels of trust based e.g.on their %%risk|risk%% tolerance and history with trust issues. A %%statement|assertion%% would typically have as many %%trust levels|trust-level%% associated with it as there are %%parties|party%% that have made such judgements. Note that %%parties|party%% may associate %%trust levels|trust-level%% to their own judgements, including judgements about their %%trust levels|trust-level%% themselves.

These %%trust level|trust-level%% judgements are typically made at the unconscious level. They depend on circumstances, and information that %%parties|party%% find relevant for such an assessment, and are able to acquire. These judgements change over time, e.g. as new information becomes available that is relevant for such judgements, or that the party decides what information that wasn't relevant before must now also be taken into account.

Assessing the %%level of trust|trust-level%% in X is distinct from deciding whether or not to actually %%trust|trust%% X, i.e. decide that X is true, or that X can be relied on to be true. For the latter determination, the %%trust level|trust-level%% of X would need to have exceeded some threshold, which typically depends on the consequences the %%party|party%% would like it to have. For example, a %%party|party%% may associate a %%trust level|trust-level%% to the %%statement|assertion%% "Mr Salesmann will not sell me junk" In a situation where the %%party|party%% buys a pear from Mr Salesmann, the %%trust level|trust-level%% would not need to be as high as in the situation where the %%party|party%% would buy a house from Mr Salesmann, in order for the %%party|party%% to %%trust|trust%% that statement (to be true).
