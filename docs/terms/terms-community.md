### Short Description
A **terms-community** is a %%community|community%% that maintains a %%terminology|terminology%% for the purpose of its members to avoid misunderstandings in their collaborations. They do so by:
- %%defining|definition%% a set of %%terms|term%% that are specific to them, and that are relevant for its members to interact as they seek to realize their individual %%objectives|objective%%.
- determining which %%terms|term%% they will be using within their %%community|community%% in the meaning as %%defined|definition%% by others.

Note that a terms-community (whose %%objectives|objective%% are limited to maintaining a %%terminology|terminology%%) would typically be a part of a larger %%community|community%% with other (additional) %%objectives|objective%%, and the %%terminology|terminology%% that is being maintained might well be devised to serve the realization of these %%objectives|objective%%.

A terms-community would typically create and (automatically) publish a %%glossary|glossary%% that contains all terms that it curates, i.e. both defined by themselves as by others. Such a document then serves as the authoritative register for terminology within the %%scope|scope%% of the (larger) %%community|community%% as it seeks to realize its community-%%objectives|objective%%. Also, this %%glossary|glossary%% is useful for non-members, as they will be enabled to understand what is being communicated within, or from that %%community|community%%.

Further details can be found in the %%terminology pattern|pattern-terminology%%.

### Purpose
The purpose of establishing and maintaining a %%terminology|terminology%%, and hence for having a %%terms-community|terms-community%%, is to ensure that any communications between its members is understood in the same meaning as it was said/written, which is prerequisite for reasoning, arguing, and making collective decisions.

### Criterion
a %%community|community%% that maintains a %%terminology|terminology%% for the purpose of its members to avoid misunderstandings in their collaborations.

## Example

* The [Trust Over IP Foundation](https://trustoverip.org)'s [Governance Stack Working Group](https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Governance+Stack+Working+Group) is the terms community developing %%terminology|terminology%% specific to the %%scope|scope%% of the ToIP governance stack.
* The [Trust Over IP Foundation](https://trustoverip.org)'s [Concepts and Terminology Working Group](https://wiki.trustoverip.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=65700) is the terms community that develops the terminology-related %%terminology|terminology%%.

## Notes

- The set of parties that form one terms-community can also form a different terms-community for the realization of other %%objectives|objective%%. For example, the members of the [ToIP CTWG](https://wiki.trustoverip.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=65700) have one set of %%objectives|objective%% related to the %%definition|definition%% and curation of terminology-related %%terms|term%%, procedures for creating good %%definitions|definition%% etc. That same group of %%parties|party%% might also serve the purposes of %%identifying|identify%% %%terms|term%% that are commonly used throughout ToIP, and ensuring that these %%terms|term%% are properly defined and curated. This set of %%parties|party%% will thus form multiple %%terms-communities|terms-community%%.
