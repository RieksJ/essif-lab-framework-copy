### Short Description
**Compliance** is the state of realization of the %%compliance objectives|compliance-objective%% of a %%party|party%%, and the processes that this %%party|party%% runs to realize them.

%%Parties|party%% can formulate compliance-%%objectives|objective%% in many ways, e.g.
- the products it manufactures or uses must comply with their specifications, EU safety regulations, etc.
- the processes that it runs must comply with applicable standards, e.g. ISO 9001 or ISO 27001
- the laws and regulations of the country in which the %%party|party%% is established must be complied with.

%%Parties|party%% that have formulated compliance-%%objectives|objective%% will need to %%manage|management%% them. The term %%compliance-management|compliance-management%% is used to refer to the %%management|management%% processes that a %%party|party%% runs to realize these %%objectives|objective%%.

Compliance with a normative framework (i.e. a set of requirements to be complied with) is typically established by an (independent) auditor, that uses an %%assessment framework|assessment-framework%% to evaluate the extent to which the %%party|party%% complies with the requirements of the normative framework. Realizing all compliance-objectives, however, would typically mean that %%compliance|compliance%% with various such frameworks will need to be established.

### Purpose
The purpose of **compliance** (being compliant, or in the process of becoming compliant) is that it may help to mitigate %%risks|risk%%, e.g. of being fined for being non-compliant. Also, it may help to provide opportunities; for example, being compliant with the ISO 9001 management requirements is often required for organizations in order to qualify for becoming a supplier.
