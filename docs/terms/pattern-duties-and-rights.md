# Duties and Rights

:::info Editor's note
This is work that is still an idea. If you want to help, do so by telling us [in a new issue](https://github.com/essif-lab/framework/issues/new).
:::

### Purpose

The **Duties-and-rights pattern** captures the concepts and relations that explain what (generic) duties and rights are, thereby following the [theory of Hohfeld](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/rights/#FormRighHohfAnalSyst), which is not only the basis of [legal systems](legal-system@) (in [jurisdictions](@)), but can be used to generically model duties and rights.

### Introduction

### Formalized model

Here is a visual representation of this pattern, using the following **[notations and conventions](../notations-and-conventions#pattern-diagram-notations)**:
