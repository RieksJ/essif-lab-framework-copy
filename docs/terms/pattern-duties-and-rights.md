### Purpose
The **Duties-and-rights pattern** captures the concepts and relations that explain what (generic) duties and rights are, thereby following the [theory of Hohfeld](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/rights/#FormRighHohfAnalSyst), which is not only the basis of %%legal systems|legal-system%% (in %%jurisdictions|jurisdiction%%), but can be used to generically model duties and rights.

### Introduction


### Formalized model
Here is a visual representation of this pattern, using the following **[notations and conventions](../notations-and-conventions#pattern-diagram-notations)**:
