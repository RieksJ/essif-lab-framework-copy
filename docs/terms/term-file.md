# Term-file

### Short Description

A **term-file** is a file that defined/specifies a specific [term](@). To facilitate authors, a self-explanatory [template file](/tev1/term-file.md) is available.

### Purpose

The ability to 'invent' a name for some [concept](@), or to use a different name if it is already known in some [scope](@), is commonly exercised by that work together (or that write software). Basically, this ability enables one to establish a [semantics](@), i.e. a mapping between an idea or concept, and a word or phrase (the term) that can be used in communications, or when reasoning about that idea/concept.

### Criterion

a file that defines/specifies a term.
