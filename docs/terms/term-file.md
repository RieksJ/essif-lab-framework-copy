### Short Description
A **term-file** is a file that defined/specifies a specific %%term|term%%. To facilitate authors, a self-explanatory [template file](/tev1/term-file.md) is available.

### Purpose
The ability to 'invent' a name for some %%concept|concept%%, or to use a different name if it is already known in some %%scope|scope%%, is commonly exercised by that work together (or that write software). Basically, this ability enables one to establish a %%semantics|semantics%%, i.e. a mapping between an idea or concept, and a word or phrase (the term) that can be used in communications, or when reasoning about that idea/concept.

### Criterion
a file that defines/specifies a term.
