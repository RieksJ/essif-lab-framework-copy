### Short Description
A **principal** is the term we use to refer to the %%party|party%% for which (on whose behalf) an %%agent|agent%% is acting. The Agent-Principal relation is an %%Actor|actor%%-%%Party|party%% relation where the actor is executing an action on behalf of that party, and for the execution of which the principle has established rules, guidelines, working-instructions, or other relevant matters that the agent must follow (and hence have access to).

### Purpose
The ability to distinguish between (non)principals is relevant in many situations, including:

### Criterion
The **principal** (of an %%actor|actor%%) is the %%party|party%% for whom the actor is an %%agent|agent%%, i.e. on whose behalf the actor is (in the process of) executing some %%action|action%%.

### Examples

- A person that is 'doing its own things' is the Principal for himself (as an Actor); the person is also an Agent for himself (as a Party).
- When a person is doing things for his employer, the latter is his Principal.
