### Short Description
<!--REQUIRED--in 1-3 sentences that describe the concept to a layperson with reasonable accuracy.-->
An **Owner** is a role that a [party](@) performs when it is exercising its legal, rightful or natural title to control some [entity](@).

We interpret 'legal' and 'rightful' as terms that apply to _any_ [jurisdiction](@) (that is: not just [legal/national jurisdictions](legal-jurisdiction@), but also those of other [parties](@), specifically [organizations](@) and [individuals](human-being@).

We take 'natural' as a title that is provided by nature, as in 'the owner of an [assertion](@)', or 'the owner of a [risk](@)'.

For futher details, see [ownership](@).

### Purpose
The ability to distinguish between (non)owners of an [entity](@) enables one to identify the [party](@) and the duties (and rights) it has regarding the [owned](@). One may want to do so either to establish whether or not the [owned](@) [entity](@), e.g. if it is an [actor](@), can be trusted to behave according to its [owner's](@) [policies](@). Or, one may want to do this in order to settle a dispute it has.

### Criteria
A [party](@) is said to be the **owner** of some [(legal) entity](legal-entity@) in some [jurisdiction](@) if and only if an [ownership relation](ownership@) exists with that [jurisdiction](@).
