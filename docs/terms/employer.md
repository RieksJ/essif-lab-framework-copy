### Short Description

An **Employer (of an Actor)** is a [party](@) on whose behalf a (human or non-human) [actor](@) (called an [employee](@) of that [party](@)) might execute [actions](@). Typically, that would be the result of the the [party](@) having (successfully) [onboarded](onboarding@) the [actor](@).

In practice, the term 'employer' often implies a [party](@) that has [onboarded](onboarding@) one or more [people](human-being@). In our way of thinking, however, this meaning is too limited. Here are some examples of [parties](@) that also qualify in the [role](@) of [employer](@):
- a [person](human-being@) (as an [party](@)) is always an [employer](@) of itself (as a [actor](@));
- a [party](@) that [controls](scope-of-control@) a technical component (an [actor](@), that is then also [onboarded](onboarding@)), also qualifies as an [employer](@) of that component.
- a [party](@) that has [mandated](mandate@) an [actor](@) (human or non-human) for executing certain [actions](@) on its behalf, qualifies as an [employer](@) of that [actor](@).

The [Parties, Actors and Actions pattern](pattern-party-actor-action@) provides an overview of how this concept fits in with related concepts.
