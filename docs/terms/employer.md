### Short Description

An **Employer (of an Actor)** is a %%party|party%% on whose behalf a (human or non-human) %%actor|actor%% (called an %%employee|employee%% of that %%party|party%%) might execute %%actions|action%%. Typically, that would be the result of the the %%party|party%% having (successfully) %%onboarded|onboarding%% the %%actor|actor%%.

In practice, the term 'employer' often implies a %%party|party%% that has %%onboarded|onboarding%% one or more %%people|human-being%%. In our way of thinking, however, this meaning is too limited. Here are some examples of %%parties|party%% that also qualify in the %%role|role%% of %%employer|employer%%:
- a %%person|human-being%% (as an %%party|party%%) is always an %%employer|employer%% of itself (as a %%actor|actor%%);
- a %%party|party%% that %%controls|scope-of-control%% a technical component (an %%actor|actor%%, that is then also %%onboarded|onboarding%%), also qualifies as an %%employer|employer%% of that component.
- a %%party|party%% that has %%mandated|mandate%% an %%actor|actor%% (human or non-human) for executing certain %%actions|action%% on its behalf, qualifies as an %%employer|employer%% of that %%actor|actor%%.

The %%Parties, Actors and Actions pattern|pattern-party-actor-action%% provides an overview of how this concept fits in with related concepts.
