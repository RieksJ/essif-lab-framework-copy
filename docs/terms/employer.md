### Short Description

An **Employer (of an Actor)** is a %%party|party%% on whose behalf a (human or non-human) %%actor|actor%% (called an %%employee|employee%% of that %%party|party%%) might execute %%actions|action%%. Typically, that would be the result of the the %%party|party%% having (successfully) %%onboarded|onboarding%% the %%actor|actor%%.

In practice, the term 'employer' often implies a %party% that has %onboarded% one or more %people%. In our way of thinking, however, this meaning is too limited. Here are some examples of %parties% that also qualify in the %role% of %employer%:
- a %person% (as an %party%) is always an %employer% of itself (as a %actor%);
- a %party% that %controls|scope-of-control% a technical component (an %actor%, that is then also %onboarded%), also qualifies as an %employer% of that component.
- a %party% that has %mandated% an %actor% (human or non-human) for executing certain %actions% on its behalf, qualifies as an %employer% of that %actor%.

The %%Parties, Actors and Actions pattern|pattern-party-actor-action%% provides an overview of how this concept fits in with related concepts.
