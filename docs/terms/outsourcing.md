### Short Description
**Oursourcing** is the state of affairs in which a %%party|party%% has an %%objective|objective%% (better: an %%expectation|expectation%%) for the realization of a (set of) result(s), where the actual production of these results is expected to be done by a %%party|party%% other than itself.

Essentially, whenever a %%party|party%% has an %%expectation|expectation%% towards another %%party|party%%, then the production or maintenance of the results associated to that %%expectation|expectation%% are said to be outsourced to that other %%party|party%%.[^1]

[^1]: One might ask whether or not [outsourcing](@) a task to a [person](@) is equivalent to [onboarding](@) that [person](@), as a [person](@) is both a [party](@) (to which one can [outsource](@) tasks) and an [actor](@) (that can be [onboarded](@)). And that is precisely how it works: as an [actor](@), it would work for the [party](@) that has [onboarded](@) it, and that [party](@) therefore would assume responsibility (be accountable for) all [actions](@) that the person executed on behalf of that [party](@). As a [party](@), the person itself would assume responsibility (be accountable for) all [actions](@) that it executes as commissioned by the [outsourcing](@) [party](@).

The outsourcing [party](@) should provide
- a [policy](@) to the other [party](@) so that it can (have one or more of its (digital and/or human) [employees](@)) produce the expected results in accordance with the intentions of the oursourcing [party](@);
- any production means that the [employees](@) of that other [party](@) may need to produce these results, insofar this other party cannot or will not provide such means.

Outsourcing introduces %%risks|risk%% that are rooted in the principle that every %%party|party%% is autonomous (sorvereing); the result(s) that are expected are produced or maintained outside the %%scope of control|scope-of-control%% of the %%party|party%% that has the %%expectation|expectation%%. Thus, the outsourcing [party](@) may want to establish a (legally binding) contract with the other [party](@) to provide assurances that the other [party](@) will (have its [employees](@)) follow the guidance of the provided [policy](@), and will use the provided production means.

### Examples
A [party](@) may want to have a [capability](@) for revoking [credentials](@) that it has issued. There are various ways in which this can be realized, one of which is to use a revocation service that is offered by another [party](@). The results that the [party](@) [expects](expectation@) the other [party](@) to produce, is the provisioning of a service that will ensure that an arbitrary [party](@) can check whether a [credential](@) that the first [party](@) has issued, has been revoked or not.
