### Short Description
**Oursourcing** is the state of affairs in which a %%party|party%% has an %%objective|objective%% (better: an %%expectation|expectation%%) for the realization of a (set of) result(s), where the actual production of these results is expected to be done by a %%party|party%% other than itself.

Essentially, whenever a %%party|party%% has an %%expectation|expectation%% towards another %%party|party%%, then the production or maintenance of the results associated to that %%expectation|expectation%% are said to be outsourced to that other %%party|party%%.[^1]

[^1]: One might ask whether or not %%outsourcing|outsourcing%% a task to a %%person|human-being%% is equivalent to %%onboarding|onboarding%% that %%person|human-being%%, as a %%person|human-being%% is both a %%party|party%% (to which one can %%outsource|outsourcing%% tasks) and an %%actor|actor%% (that can be %%onboarded|onboarding%%). And that is precisely how it works: as an %%actor|actor%%, it would work for the %%party|party%% that has %%onboarded|onboarding%% it, and that %%party|party%% therefore would assume responsibility (be accountable for) all %%actions|action%% that the person executed on behalf of that %%party|party%%. As a %%party|party%%, the person itself would assume responsibility (be accountable for) all %%actions|action%% that it executes as commissioned by the %%outsourcing|outsourcing%% %%party|party%%.

The outsourcing %%party|party%% should provide
- a %%policy|policy%% to the other %%party|party%% so that it can (have one or more of its (digital and/or human) %%employees|employee%%) produce the expected results in accordance with the intentions of the oursourcing %%party|party%%;
- any production means that the %%employees|employee%% of that other %%party|party%% may need to produce these results, insofar this other party cannot or will not provide such means.

Outsourcing introduces %%risks|risk%% that are rooted in the principle that every %%party|party%% is autonomous (sorvereing); the result(s) that are expected are produced or maintained outside the %%scope of control|scope-of-control%% of the %%party|party%% that has the %%expectation|expectation%%. Thus, the outsourcing %%party|party%% may want to establish a (legally binding) contract with the other %%party|party%% to provide assurances that the other %%party|party%% will (have its %%employees|employee%%) follow the guidance of the provided %%policy|policy%%, and will use the provided production means.

### Examples
A %%party|party%% may want to have a %%capability|capability%% for revoking %%credentials|credential%% that it has issued. There are various ways in which this can be realized, one of which is to use a revocation service that is offered by another %%party|party%%. The results that the %%party|party%% %%expects|expectation%% the other %%party|party%% to produce, is the provisioning of a service that will ensure that an arbitrary %%party|party%% can check whether a %%credential|credential%% that the first %%party|party%% has issued, has been revoked or not.
