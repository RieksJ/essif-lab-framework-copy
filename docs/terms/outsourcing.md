### Short Description
**Oursourcing** is the state of affairs in which a %%party|party%% has an %%objective|objective%% for the realization of a (set of) result(s), where the actual production of these results is expected to be done by a %%party|party%% other than itself.

Essentially, whenever a %%party|party%% has an %%expectation|expectation%% towards another %%party|party%%, then the production or maintenance of the results associated to that %%expectation|expectation%% are said to be outsourced to that other %%party|party%%.

Outsourcing introduces %%risks|risk%% that are rooted in the principle that every %%party|party%% is autonomous (sorvereing); the result(s) that are expected are produced or maintained outside the %%scope of control|scope-of-control%% of the %%party|party%% that has the %%expectation|expectation%%.
