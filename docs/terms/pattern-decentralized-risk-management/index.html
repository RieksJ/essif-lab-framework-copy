Most (large) enterprises have adopted (a mix of) them, and many have been certified (e.g. against <a href="https://www.iso.org/iso-9001-quality-management.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ISO 9001</a> or <a href="https://www.iso.org/isoiec-27001-information-security.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ISO 27001</a>) thereby demonstrating they govern and run the associated (risk)management processes as intended, and are compliant with such standards and often also with applicable regulations.</p><p>However, these frameworks don&#x27;t provide practical guidance for all situations. For example, it is well-known that SMEs or other parties that do not have the required (expert) knowledge, time and other resources to setup and run such processes, are pretty much left to their own devices. Also, <a href="/framework/docs/terms/self-sovereign-identity"><span style="font-weight:bold">SSI</span></a> provides contexts for which the traditional RM frameworks do not provide the necessary guidance.</p><p>This pattern provides a way of thinking about <a href="/framework/docs/terms/risk"><span style="font-weight:bold">risks</span></a> that is suitable for <a href="/framework/docs/terms/self-sovereign-identity"><span style="font-weight:bold">SSI contexts</span></a> (and as a side-effect, it may be userful for SME&#x27;s (and the like) as well). It is not intended to replace these other frameworks, but rather as a complementary mechanism. Where the existing frameworks mostly focus on the internal workings of <a href="/framework/docs/terms/party"><span style="font-weight:bold">parties</span></a>, our mechanisms mostly focuses on risks related to interactions between parties.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2cZh" id="the-generic-risk-management-process-according-to-iso"></a>The Generic Risk Management Process (according to ISO)<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="hash-link" href="#the-generic-risk-management-process-according-to-iso" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>The following figure, that also appeared in ISO standards 31000 and 27005, shows a generic risk management process:</p><img alt="High-level transaction negotiation" src="/framework/images/essif-lab-iso-risk-management-process.png"><p><em>Figure 1: Activities in a Generic ISO Risk Management Process.</em></p><p>It shows that the core of an RM process is a cycle of activities that starts with &#x27;context establishment&#x27;. The purpose here is that you know about the context you are in, both your external environment (what you cannot control) and your internal environment (what you can control). You must also know the <a href="/framework/docs/terms/objective"><span style="font-weight:bold">objectives</span></a> you want to manage the risks of (for according to ISO, risk only exists in the context of objectives). Then you must know the purpose and scope of the RM process, and establish your risk criteria (i.e. the criteria you use to evaluate the significance of risk and make decisions concerning its acceptability).</p><p>The core activity is Risk Assessment, which contains three sub-activities:</p><ol><li>Risk Identification. This is where you identify risks and their range of possible effects (consequences) on the objectives;</li><li>Risk Analysis. Here you extend your understanding of the identified risks, and provide some measure of the magnitude of risk;</li><li>Risk Evaluation. That is where you decide whether or not a risk is acceptable in relation to the objectives and the risk criteria you have established.
Additional guidance on techniques that can help you do this are provided in <a href="https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iec:31010:ed-2:v1:en,fr" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ISO 31010</a>, the (upcoming revised version of) ISO 27005 and many other sources.</li></ol><p>The &#x27;risk treatment&#x27; activity aims to do whatever is necessary to manage the unacceptable risks. ISO 31000 lists various options for doing so, which are not necessarily mutually exclusive or appropriate in all circumstances:</p><ul><li>avoiding the risk by deciding not to start or continue with the activity that gives rise to the risk;</li><li>taking or increasing the risk in order to pursue an opportunity;</li><li>removing the risk source;</li><li>changing the likelihood;</li><li>changing the consequences;</li><li>sharing the risk with another party or parties through contracts;</li><li>risk financing (internally e.g. retention, or transfer e.g. buying insurance);</li><li>retaining the risk by informed decision.</li></ul><p>Your choices will have consequences, large or small, in the way you continue to operate. You might start doing some things differently, make changes in your IT or other tools, etc. These activities are outside the scope of risk management.</p><p>The other two activities, &#x27;Risk Communication and Consulation&#x27;, and &#x27;Monitoring and review&#x27; are not activities like the others in the sense that you continually have to communicate and consult with your stakeholders and advisors so that they can help you reach your objectives (and vice versa) and make good judgements and choices. You also need to continually monitor and review (the changes you have made in) the ways you work, the tools you use, and the context that you are in so that you will notice when risks arise that may not/no longer be acceptable, which will lead to a review of your context (context estanblishment) and a subsequent risk assessment.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2cZh" id="networked-risk-management"></a>Networked Risk Management<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="hash-link" href="#networked-risk-management" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><a href="/framework/docs/terms/risk-management"><span style="font-weight:bold">Networked risk management</span></a> is a way for managing the <a href="/framework/docs/terms/risk"><span style="font-weight:bold">risks</span></a> of a single <a href="/framework/docs/terms/party"><span style="font-weight:bold">party</span></a>, taking into account that Our definitions of <a href="/framework/docs/terms/risk"><span style="font-weight:bold">risk</span></a>, <a href="/framework/docs/terms/risk-owner"><span style="font-weight:bold">risk owner</span></a> and other risk-related terms are aligned with those of ISO, but (contrary to those of) but there are some subtle differences. much more explicit In ISO standards, the person or entity (say: the <a href="/framework/docs/terms/party"><span style="font-weight:bold">party</span></a>) with the accountability and authority to manage a risk is called the &#x27;risk owner&#x27;.<a href="/framework/docs/terms/risk-management"><span style="font-weight:bold">Networked Risk Management</span></a> is a management process that is run by (or on behalf of) a <a href="/framework/docs/terms/party"><span style="font-weight:bold">party</span></a> for the purpose of managing the <a href="/framework/docs/terms/risk"><span style="font-weight:bold">risks</span></a> that this party <a href="/framework/docs/terms/owner"><span style="font-weight:bold">owns</span></a>.<h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2cZh" id="scoping"></a>Scoping<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="hash-link" href="#scoping" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>All (ISO and non-ISO) frameworks start by requiring that you define the scope (also called &#x27;context&#x27;) of your management processes. And for good reason: you will be in charge of whatever you will be managing in such processes. To this we add the requirement is that</p><ul><li>a context must have a single owner, i.e. a <a href="/framework/docs/terms/party"><span style="font-weight:bold">party</span></a> that is in charge of what happens in that context, and that consequently should be managing the <a href="/framework/docs/terms/risk"><span style="font-weight:bold">risks</span></a> therein.</li><li>a context must fall within the <a href="/framework/docs/terms/scope-of-control"><span style="font-weight:bold">scope of control</span></a> of its <a href="/framework/docs/terms/owner"><span style="font-weight:bold">owner</span></a>, as it is hard to manage risks or other things if you cannot control them.</li></ul><p>In decentralized contexts we deal with ecosystems of autonomous ((self)sovereign) parties, it is a given that the scope of control of each such party does not extend beyond the party itself - it&#x27;s the very definition of autonomy/sovereignty. A party could use an ISO standard to manage X (risks, ...), but SHOULD limit its scope to be within its own scope of control.
The only guidance that such a party gets from ISO standards regarding how to deal with risks that relate to stuff outside the scope, are the &#x27;identification of &#x27;interested parties&#x27; (that may work with you, or against you) and &#x27;communication&#x27; (about the topics you are managing).
I think that ToIP governance should be aware of this pitfall and SHOULD NOT attempt to create or support frameworks that are meant to be used to do governance over autonomous parties. Rather, the WG/TF should focus on doing governance that assists such parties as they autonomously make their own, subjective decisions that are good for them individually, but perhaps not so good for others. That&#x27;s a challenge.
But if we succeed here, this can be a real contribution,  not only for ToIP, but also for the various management standards in ISO. So we don&#x27;t do away with such standards, but we complement them by providing ways to deal with larger, decentralized contexts of autonomous parties.
Secondly, governance and trust assurance should not be limited to IT security (ISO 27001, ISO 27005). It should also cover business risks, e.g. of a business transaction going sour. After all, I think that a large part of data in credentials that are being exchanged serve to provide information to parties that are negotiating/conducting a business transaction, so that they can (subjectively/autonomously) assess their individual transaction risk(level)s, and mitigate such risks such that the residual risk becomes acceptable. This, and other topics, aren&#x27;t covered by ISO 27001 nor ISO 27005. So we should take a broader look than these.</p><p>Traditional risk management (RM) frameworks are currently not fit for use in decentralized contexts. Frameworks such as ISO 31000, or COSO, (tacitly) assume centralized organizational leadership and auditing, and cyclic (PDCA) processes for risk management. While predominantly large enterprises have adopted (a mix of) them, it is way too cumbersome for SME&#x27;s and individuals to work with. Also, their being adopted by enterprises suggests they are inappropriate in decentralized, networked contexts. This paper proposes a way for identifying and managing risks and doing the associated governance and compliance in a way that <em>is</em> appropriate in such contexts.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2cZh" id="introduction"></a>Introduction<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="hash-link" href="#introduction" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>Perhaps the best known approach is based on Assets Threats/Hazards and Vulnerabilities (ATV). It starts with making an inventory of the party&#x27;s assets (things that are valuable to that party), list the threats to such assets (ways in which they lose (part of) their value), and vulnerabilities (weak spots in assets that increase the likelihood of threats being effective). Then, the likelihood of such threats occuring may be assessed, as well as the impact (often: damages) they would have. Combining these two enables a party to assess its risk levels. For the risks that are unacceptable, a treatment plan must be conceived, the execution of which supposedly reduces (or: gets rid of) the risk. This, but also: changing circumstances, change the risks the party runs, which means that it has to repeat all these steps in a continuous mananagement cycle. Mature RM-processes will also include other things, such as communications with the party&#x27;s stakeholders, regular audits, etc.</p><p>Another well known method, predominantly for industry, is <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925753516300078" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bowtie</a>. It focuses on events that may occur, a &#x27;fault tree&#x27; (i.e. a graph that identifies the relevant causes/threats) and an &#x27;event tree&#x27; (i.e. a graph of possible consequences/outcomes). The have the &#x27;barrier&#x27; concepts, which represents a measure that aims to prevent threats from materializing, or reduce the effect of possible consequences. As with ATV, implementing/changing measures, as well as changing circumstances, require set of events and graphs to be appropriately managed. This entails deciding about the (un)acceptability of unwanted consequences, and implementing barriers as needed - which change circumstances.</p><p>RM approaches such as the ones mentioned above have severe practical limitations. Individuals and many SME&#x27;s do RM intuitively, they &#x27;know&#x27; where the risks are that need to be mitigated. They consider such approaches as an inefficient way of finding out what they already know. In large organizations, we&#x27;ve seen lots of activities being conducted in order to comply with the RM-process requirements, but did not contribute all that much to managing actual risk.</p><p>An illustration of this is an incident that took place in January 2012 at the Dutch telco KPN. IT security has long been an IT priority for KPN: its CEOs are member of the &#x27;<a href="https://www.cybersecurityraad.nl/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cyber Security Raad</a>&#x27;, a national and independent advisory college of the Dutch government whose mission is to increase cybersecurity throughout the country. Also, its critical services have been certified against ISO 9001 and ISO 27001. Notwithstanding all this, a 17 year old boy <a href="https://tweakers.net/nieuws/87454/kpn-hacker-zag-acties-als-een-kwajongensstreek.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">broke into hundreds of servers</a>, where he could have manipulated KPNs fixed telecom network putting the reachability of the national emergency number 112 (911 in the US) at risk. The question here is why the traditional methods were unable to prevent this from happening.</p><p>Another illustration comes from the <a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OWASP Top 10</a> list of web application security risks. This list, which exists since 2003 and is regularly updated, shows that the variety of vulnerabilities in applications does not change all that much: injection, broken authentication, cross-site scripting, using components with known vulnerabilities are here to stay. The question here is what is missing in the RM processes of small and large organizations alike that makes many of them deploy systems with such vulnerabilities, in spite of the vast amount of guidance that OWASP provides for preventing them.</p><p>One reason for this may be that risks must be owned. That is to say: there must be a person (not: an organization) that actually feels &#x27;pain&#x27; (discomfort, anxiety, ...) when that risk is not acceptable. This is a different kind of ownership than what we have seen a lot, which is writing the name of a person next to a risk. The latter is ineffective if that person doesn&#x27;t feel the associated pain.</p><p>Another reason is that the number of risks a person needs to deal with must be manageable. <a href="https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/threat-risk-management/risk-management/current-risk/risk-management-inventory/rm-ra-methods/m_cramm.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CRAMM</a> (1985-2003) is a RM method + tool that helped organizations do their risk assessments by providing threats to, and vulnerabilities of, various kinds of assets. As the number of technological products exploded, so did their database, resulting in a CRAMM risk assessment becoming unacceptably costly and long. Also, it produced ever more mitigation measures. For <a href="/framework/docs/terms/management"><span style="font-weight:bold">managers</span></a>, it was obvious that many of them were irrelevant and the required budgets would not be available.</p><p>A third reason is that risks should be relevant in order to be treated. For example, the risk of leaking a cryptographic key from a crypto chip that is vulnerable to power/timing-attacks is irrelevant e.g. when the chip and its battery are sealed in a physical casing. Also, the risk of crashing your car as a result of an autopilot failure is irrelevant if you never use the autopilot.</p><p>The last reason we mention is that people generally prefer activities that help them realize their objectives rather than activities that do not (visibly) contribute. Many governance, RM and compliance (GRC) related activities fall in that second category, except perhaps for people whose job is &#x27;doing GRC&#x27;. Having to do such activities is a typical trait of centrally organized GRC.</p><p>The alternative for putting effort in preventing failures is focusing on the flip-side of that coin, which is: putting effort in realizing successes. It stimulates people to own the associated risks and manage them (it makes the pain go away). When the risks become unmanageable, the associated pain may indicate you have an objective of staying healthy, which you might mitigate by outsourcing the realization of one or more of your objectives.</p><p>To illustrate the difference between these approaches, consider a doctor whose objective is to get her patients in a continuous healthy state and keep them there. When a patient is not in such a state, she won&#x27;t inventory <em>everything</em> that could be wrong with the patient as traditional methods would have her do. Rather, she looks at what is preventing the patient from becoming/remaining healthy, makes a treatment plan, and has it executed.That&#x27;s much easier. And when she needs to see too many patients, she (literally) feels the associated agony and will try to offload some of the patients to trusted colleagues.</p><p>Realizing successes is an inherently decentralized concept, because in the end, being succesful always depends on some kind of recognition of others: if you provide a service or product, your success depends on the value they have for your customers, which they express by paying you money, or providing you with a service or product of their own. Positive motivators stimulate parties to increasingly interact and work together to the benefit of both. In contrast, centralized settings have a tendency to use negative motivators to make people interact and work together.</p><p>Different methods have been around for some time now that may be part of decentralized GRC (and in particular: decentralized RM). One such method is the Open Group&#x27;s <a href="https://publications.opengroup.org/c133" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dependency Modeling standard</a> (DM - also available on <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/305884742_Open_Group_Standard_Dependency_Modeling_O-DM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ResearchGate</a>). It specifies a way by which a party can inventory its goals, and compute the probabilities of achieving them by combining the probilities of the goals that they depend on. Statistical operations then identify points (objectives) of failure that need to be addressed.</p><p>Another, complementary method is <a href="https://repository.tno.nl/islandora/object/uuid:95b1a97a-2d5c-41b1-b5d9-43bcd04d981b" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Networked Risk Management (NRM)</a>. Next to the role of &#x27;objective Owner&#x27;, NRM adds two others: the Producer is the party that is responsible for realizing the results by which it can be established (e.g. by an auditor, or customers) whether or not an objective is met/realized/fulfilled. A Consumer is a party that uses these results for the purpose of realizing one or more objectives that it owns. An objective Owner states the objective, specifies the (auditable) results, and must be the Producer and/or Consumer thereof. Risks are associated with an objective, and map the objective to a risk level, i.e. a measure that is meaningful to the owner and that indicates the extent to which the objective is not (going to be) met.
