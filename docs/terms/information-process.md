# Information Process

### Short Description

An **Information Process** is a coherent set of [actions@] that are (to be) performed by a single [party@], in which [data](@) (that is controlled by this [party](@) is created, read, updated and/or deleted.

While it is possible that a process includes [actions](@) that also create, use, modify and/or delete other things (as in production or manufacturing processes), this is out of scope when we specifically deal with [information processes](information-process@).
