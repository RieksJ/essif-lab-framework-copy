## Short Description
The **Corpus** or **Corpus of Terminology** is the documentation that describes the %%knowledge|knowledge%% around a set of %%terms|term%% and %%concepts|concept%%. It is typically %%governed|governance%% by conventions that are specified by a group of %%terms communities|terms-community%%, such as [TOIP's Concepts and Terminology Working Group](https://wiki.trustoverip.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=65700).

The %%Terminology Pattern|pattern-terminology%% relates this concept with other terminological %%concepts|concept%%.

## Purpose
The purpose of having a %%corpus|corpus%% is that it allows for the development of tools that support authors and groups of people to better communicate, by enabling them to refer to the %%definition|definition%% of a %%term|term%% whenever that %%term|term%% is used. This is particularly beneficial when a specific %%term|term%% can be interpreted in different ways (according to different %%definitions|definition%%).

Tools that we envisage will query for %%terms|term%% from the %%corpus|corpus%%, and use that e.g. to create a custom %%glossary|glossary%% document, a %%terminology|terminology%% appendix in a paper you write, or as a resource from which you generate pop-up balloons in a website you create.
