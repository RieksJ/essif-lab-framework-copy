### Short Description
**Compliance management** is the process that is run by (or on behalf of) a specific %%party|party%% for the purpose of %%managing|management%% its %%compliance objectives|compliance-objective%%.

In its core, %%compliance management|compliance-management%% is a %%management|management%% process like any other. It can be set apart because the %%actors|actor%% that do the work will need to have %%knowledge|knowledge%% about the relevant laws, policies and regulations (for regulatory %%compliance|compliance%%), and/or relevant standards such as ISO 9001 or ISO 27001 (for certification), or other relevant rules, requirements and other normative frameworks.

Part of %%compliance management|compliance-management%% is to determine the %%compliance objectives|compliance-objective%% that state which %%entities|entity%% are in scope, and what the normative frameworks are that each of them must comply with. Compliance with a %%normative framework|normative-framework%% is typically established by an (independent) auditor, that uses an %%assessment framework|assessment-framework%% to evaluate the extent to which the party complies with the requirements of the %%normative framework|normative-framework%%.

### Purpose
The purpose of having compliance-management set apart from the more generic %%management|management%% is that it often requires the involvement of people or third party organizations that have appropriate legal and/or regulatory knowledge that is not required in other kinds of %%management|management%% processes.

### Criteria
A %%compliance management|compliance-management%% process (of a %%party|party%%) is a %%management|management%%-process that is run by (or on behalf of) that %%party|party%%, where the %%objectives|objective%% that are managed pursue the state of affairs in which specific %%entities|entity%% that the %%party|party%% controls (which can also be that %%party|party%% itself) comply with a specified set of requirements.
