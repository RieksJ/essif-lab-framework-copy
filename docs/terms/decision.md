# Decision

### Short Description

A **decision** (of a [party](@)) is the conclusion that this [party](@) inferences from a set of [data](@) that it considers to be facts. The method of inferencing does not need to be mathematically sound (and more often than not, that is in fact the case). [Toulmin's model for reasoning](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/uses-of-argument/26CF801BC12004587B66778297D5567C) is a generic and useful model for explaining how decisions generally come to pass.

The (envisaged) [decision-making model](pattern-decision-making@) elaborates further on this.

### Purpose

Making **decisions** is the very reason for having [SSI](self-sovereign-identity@) technology, as the [data](@) in [credentials](@) provide the facts that [parties](@) use to make them.

### Criteria

A **decision** (of a [party](@)) is the conclusion that a [party](@) inferences from a set of [data](@) that it considers to be facts.
