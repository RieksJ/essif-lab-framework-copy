### Short Description
A **glossary-file** is a file that contains the specification of what does (not) go into a specific [glossary](@). To facilitate authors, a self-explanatory [template file](/tev1/glossary-file.md) is available.

### Purpose
[Glossaries](@) are [dictionaries](@) that are limited to a specific purpose or [scope](@). They provide a single meaning for each term, enabling both authors and readers to quickly establish if they associate a term with the meaning as it is defined for that scope.

### Criterion
a file that defines/specifies a [glossary](@).
