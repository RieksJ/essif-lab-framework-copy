# Identity

### Short Description

The **Identity** (of an [entity](@)) is the combined [knowledge](@) about that [entity](@) of all [parties](@), i.e. the union of all [partial identities](partial-identity@) of which that [entity](@) is the [subject](@).

We realize that this is a term that is heavily debated. However for our purposes, it is useful to see the identity of a person (or other [entity](@)) as the union of all characteristics, judgements and other [knowledge](@) that [parties](@) have about that person.

[Pfitzmann and Hansen (2010)](https://dud.inf.tu-dresden.de/literatur/Anon_Terminology_v0.34.pdf) refer to this as the 'complete identity' of the person (or entity).

The [Self-Identity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-concept) or [Self-concept](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-concept) of a [party](@) is the [partial identity](@) of which it is both the [subject](@) and the [owner](@).

The way we define 'identity' seems to be very much in line with the paradigm of [identity as a network](https://aeon.co/essays/the-self-is-not-singular-but-a-fluid-network-of-identities), as worked out by Kathleen Wallace: "[The Network Self](https://www.routledge.com/The-Network-Self-Relation-Process-and-Personal-Identity-1st-Edition/Wallace/p/book/9780367077488)".
