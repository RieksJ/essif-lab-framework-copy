### Short Description
The **Identity** (of an %%entity|entity%%) is the union of all %%partial identities|partial-identity%% of which that Entity is the %%subject|subject%%.

We realize that this is a term that is heavily debated. However for our purposes, it is useful to see the identity of a person (or other %%entity|entity%%) as the union of all characteristics, judgements and other %%knowledge|knowledge%% that %%parties|party%% have about that person.

[Pfitzmann and Hansen (2010)](https://dud.inf.tu-dresden.de/literatur/Anon_Terminology_v0.34.pdf) refer to this as the 'complete identity' of the person (or entity).

The [Self-Identity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-concept) or [Self-concept](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-concept) of a %%party|party%% is the %%partial identity|partial-identity%% of which it is both the %%subject|subject%% and the %%owner|owner%%.
