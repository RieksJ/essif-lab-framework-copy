# Attribute

### Short Description

An **Attribute** is [data](@), that represents a characteristic that a [party](@) (the [owner](@) of the [attribute](@)) has attributed to an [entity](@) (the [subject](@) of the [attribute](@)). An attribute typically represents a [statement](assertion@) ([assertion](@), [claim](assertion@)) of its [owner](@), that states the attribution of that characteristic to its [subject](@).

Note that
- the [party](@) that has stated its attribution of the characteristic to the [entity](@) [owns](@) the [attribute](@);
- the [entity](@) wo which the characteristic is attributed, is the [subject](@) of the [attribute](@).
