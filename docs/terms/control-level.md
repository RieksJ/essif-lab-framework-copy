### Short Description
A **control-level** is a measure for the efficiency and effectiveness in which a %%control|controller%% produces the results specified by its %%control objective|control-objective%%.

Like %%risk levels|risk-level%% and %%compliance levels|compliance-level%%, %%control-levels|control-level%% can be expressed in many forms.

To ensure this, %%parties|party%% may specify the %%assessment framework(s)|assessment-framework%% that auditors should use for assessing the efficiency and effectiveness of controls, and thereby determine their respective %%control levels|control-level%%.

### Purpose
The purpose of control-levels is help %%parties|party%% determine and prioritize the work that needs to be done in order to maintain the efficiency and effectiveness of their %%controls|controller%%.

### Criteria
A %%control-level|control-level%%
- is a measure of some kind (e.g. 'Low', 'Medium', 'High', or a digit in some integer interval, or similar);
- signifies a statement about how efficient and effective a %%control|controller%% realizes its associated %%control objective|control-objective%%;
- is associated with a %%party|party%% that uses it to determine and prioritize the work that needs to be done in order to maintain the efficiency and effectiveness of their %%controls|controller%%;
- can be the result of assessing the efficiency and effectiveness of a %%control|controller%%.
