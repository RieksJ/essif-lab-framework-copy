### Short Description
A **control-level** is a measure for the efficiency and effectiveness in which a [control](controller@) produces the results specified by its [control objective](@).

Like [risk levels](risk-level@) and [compliance levels](compliance-level@), [control-levels](@) can be expressed in many forms. The single criterion for expressing it is whether it helps the [owner](@) of the [control](controller@) to determine, in the [governance](@) process of that [control](controller@), whether or not to make changes to the assessed [controls](controller@), and if so, what kinds of changes are called for.

To ensure this, [parties](@) may specify the [assessment framework(s)](assessment-framework@) that auditors should use for assessing the efficiency and effectiveness of controls, and thereby determine their respective [control levels](control-level@).

### Purpose
The purpose of control-levels is help [parties](@) determine and prioritize the work that needs to be done in order to maintain the efficiency and effectiveness of their [controls](controller@).

### Criteria
A [control-level](@)
- is a measure of some kind (e.g. 'Low', 'Medium', 'High', or a digit in some integer interval, or similar);
- signifies a statement about how efficient and effective a [control](controller@) realizes its associated [control objective](@);
- is associated with a [party](@) that uses it to determine and prioritize the work that needs to be done in order to maintain the efficiency and effectiveness of their [controls](controller@);
- can be the result of assessing the efficiency and effectiveness of a [control](controller@).
