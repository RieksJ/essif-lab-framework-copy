# Validator

:::info Editor's note
*This text needs to be revised. (see also "issuer", "verifier" for inspiration)*
In other SSI contexts, this term has a different meaning. We intend to rework the framework in such a way that we can use this term in various ways (e.g. as a [party](@), a [role name](@), or an [actor](@) that performs the [role](@) associated with the [role name](@)

### Short Description

A **validator** is a (functional) component that implements the [capability](@) to determine whether or not (verified) data is [valid](validate@) to be used for some specific purpose(s).
