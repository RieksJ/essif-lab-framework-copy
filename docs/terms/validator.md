In other SSI contexts, this term has a different meaning. We intend to rework the framework in such a way that we can use this term in various ways (e.g. as a %%party|party%%, a %%role name|role-name%%, or an %%actor|actor%% that performs the %%role|role%% associated with the %%role name|role-name%%
