### Short Description
**Trust** (of a %%party|party%% in X) is the (un)conscious decision by that %%party|party%% that X is in fact the case. X can be anything. To trust is to believe to the extent that one can rely on X to be the case. One can trust a president - e.g. to make the right decisions. One may trust (rely on) one's own judgements or conscience.

%%Trust|trust%% is distinct from %%trust level|trust-level%%, which is a (subjective) *degree* of belief or confidence that a %%party|party%% has in (the truth of) X. In order to trust X, the associated %%trust level|trust-level%% of X would need to have exceeded some threshold, which typically depends on the consequences the %%party|party%% would like it to have. For example, a %%party|party%% may associate some %%trust level|trust-level%% to the %%statement|assertion%% "Mr Salesmann will not sell me junk" The threshold for that %%party|party%% actually trusting that this is in fact the case is typically lower when the %%party|party%% buys a pear from Mr Salesmann, than when it would buy a house from Mr Salesmann.

Trust is not something that is given, but something that %%parties|party%% (un)consciously, and continually decide about - it changes over time. Since %%parties|party%% are autonomous, their %%trust|trust%% is highly subjective. As a consequence, the idea of having 'trusted registries', 'trusted issuers' that do not take this subjectivity into account basically act as %%(centralized) authorities|authority%%, is a denial of the fact that %%parties|party%% are autonomous. While we acknowledge that such ideas (have a right to) exist, we do not follow them.

In many practical situations, trust has a few basic issues, in that it is often not clear
- who the actual %%party|party%% is in which the belief or confidence is rooted, i.e. that decides about that %%trust|trust%%.
- what X actually is, i.e. what it is that the %%party|party%% believes to be true (confides in, relies on).
