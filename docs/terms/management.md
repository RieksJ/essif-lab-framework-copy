### Short Description
**Management** is the %%act|action%% or process of managing or actually realizing of (the results associated with) a set of  %%objectives|objective%% that are %%owned|owned%% by a single %%party|party%%. This act or process is conducted by (%%agents|agent%% that do so on behalf of) this %%party|party%%.

Management is about planning and organizing the budgets and other resources so that they become (and/or remain) available _to produce the results_ of the associated %%objectives|objective%%. It includes the specification of timelines (deadlines) for the production, as well as the properties and other characteristics (security, quality, sustainability, etc.) of what is actually being produced/maintained. It also deals with making the tools and %%policies|policy%% (e.g. working instructions) available for doing all this.
In order to keep tabs on the efficiency of the %%management|management%% process, performance indicators may be developed, i.e. gauges that measure how well the resources are spent in this production/maintenance work are also part of this.

The %%management|management%% of a set of %%objectives|objective%% can be implemented as a %%control process|control-process%%. The control objectives that are needed by this control process would typically come from a %%policy|policy%% of the owner of the %%objectives|objective%% that are managed.

We make a clear distinction between %%governance|governance%% and %%management|management%%, which is explained in the %%governance and management pattern|pattern-governance-and-management%%.

### Purpose
The purpose for a %%party|party%% of having a **management** process is that it enables him to efficiently realize (the results associated with) various subset of its %%objectives|objective%%, to change the specification of the associated results as needed, and to make sure the results are actually going to be used by itself or some other %%party|party%%.
