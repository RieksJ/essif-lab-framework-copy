# Management

### Short Description

**Management** is the [act](action@) or process of managing or actually realizing of (the results associated with) a set of  [objectives](@) that are [owned](@) by a single [party](@). This act or process is conducted by ([agents](@) that do so on behalf of) this [party](@).

Management is about planning and organizing the budgets and other resources so that they become (and/or remain) available _to produce the results_ of the associated [objectives](@). It includes the specification of timelines (deadlines) for the production, as well as the properties and other characteristics (security, quality, sustainability, etc.) of what is actually being produced/maintained. It also deals with making the tools and [policies](@) (e.g. working instructions) available for doing all this.
In order to keep tabs on the efficiency of the [management](@) process, performance indicators may be developed, i.e. gauges that measure how well the resources are spent in this production/maintenance work are also part of this.

The [management](@) of a set of [objectives](@) can be implemented as a [control process](@). The control objectives that are needed by this control process would typically come from a [policy](@) of the owner of the [objectives](@) that are managed.

We make a clear distinction between [governance](@) and [management](@), which is explained in the [governance and management pattern](pattern:governance-and-management@).

### Purpose

The purpose for a [party](@) of having a **management** process is that it enables him to efficiently realize (the results associated with) various subset of its [objectives](@), to change the specification of the associated results as needed, and to make sure the results are actually going to be used by itself or some other [party](@).
