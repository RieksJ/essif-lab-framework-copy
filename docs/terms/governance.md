### Short Description
**Governance** is the act (executed by, or behalf of some %%party|party%%) or process (of some %%party|party%%) of governing or overseeing the control and direction of something ([Merriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/governance)). Governance is about establishing the ways in which a party makes its decisions; they are 'meta-decisions': decisions about decision-making.

As parties interact with one another, i.e. conduct %%business transactions|business-transaction%%, they need to decide whether or not to commit to a transaction proposal. Deciding about how to make such a decision is one of the subjects of the governance process of that party: it is establishing the kind of argument that may be used to make this decision.

Within eSSIF-Lab, governance is pretty much limited to the governance of various %%policies|policy%%.

### Purpose
The purpose for a %%party|party%% of having a **governance** process is that it enables him to reflect on the ways that it makes decisions. A typical topic for governance is the maintenance of the set of rules, working-instructions and other guidance that %%actors|actor%% are supposed, or required to use when executing specific %%actions|action%% on behalf of that %%party|party%%. 

For %%digital-actors%% such guidance consists of %%digital policies|digital-policy%%. A %%party|party%% whose governance process maintains a %%policy|policy%% will be called the %%governor|policy-governor%% of that policy.

### Background
The %%Parties, Actors and Actions pattern|pattern-party-actor-action%% provides an overview of how this concept fits in with related concepts.
