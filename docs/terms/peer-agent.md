%%Parties|party%% that participate in a (business) transaction may use %%Agents|agent%%, e.g. for conducting communications, exchanging information, etc. We need a term that can be used in the context of an Agent of such a %%party|party%% to refer to an Actor with which that Agent communicates, and of which it has been established that it is actually an Agent of a %%Peer %%party|party%%|peer-party%% of the %%party|party%% for which it is communicating.

The term 'peer agent' is specifically used in the context of a (digital) Actor that communicates with another (digital) Actor on behalf of a %%party|party%% that is conducting a (business) transaction with some other %%party|party%%.
