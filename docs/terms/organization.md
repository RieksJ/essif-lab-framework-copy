### Short Description
An **Organization** is a [party](@) that is capable of setting [objectives](@) and making sure these are realized by [actors](@) that it has [onboarded](onboarding@) and/or by (vetted) [parties](@) that are committed to contribute to these [objectives](@).

Enterprises and governments are the canonical examples. However, parts of enterprises (e.g. divisions, departments, business units) also qualify, as do governmental bodies.

### Purpose
The purpose of documenting this term is to provide additional clarity w.r.t. definitions given in english dictionaries. Also, we need this notion as it is used in the eSSIF-Lab [Parties, Actors and Actions pattern](pattern-party-actor-action@).

### Criteria
A [party](@) that is associated with a (non-empty) group of [onboarded](onboarding@) [actors](@) and/or (vetted) [parties](@) that work to realize its (non-empty set of) [objectives](@). The [actors](@) may be [owned](owner@) by that [party](@), or otherwise [onboarded](onboarding@). The [parties](@) will be vetted, and have an agreement with the [organization](@) regarding the rights and duties involved in making their contributions.

### Examples
- Enterprises and governments are the prototypical examples.
- Parts of enterprises (e.g. divisions, departments, business units) and governmental bodies also qualify.
- An individual person satisfies the criteria and hence qualifies (but see the Notes below).

### Notes
One may question whether or not a single person can be a 'group of people' (who would obviously work to realize its personal objectives) and hence qualify as an organization. We do not answer this question as it is irrelevant within our context, because we reason with the [concept](@) [party](@) rather than the [concepts](@) '[organization](@)' and/or '[person](human-being@)'.
