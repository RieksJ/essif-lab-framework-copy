### Short Description
<!--REQUIRED--in 1-3 sentences that describe the concept to a layperson with reasonable accuracy.-->
A Term is a word or phrase that is used in at least one context (and/or for specific purposes) to refer to a specific %%concept|concept%%. As a concequence:
- the meaning of a Term may vary across contexts. For example, in the context of a buty-salon, the term 'nail' has a different meaning than in the context of constructing buildings.
- different terms (in different contexts) may refer to the same concept ([synonymity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synonym)).

### Purpose
<!--Describe why the concept is needed. What purposes does it serve? What can you do with it that you cannot do (as well) without it? What objectives does it help realize? Why is this conceptevant within its scope of definition?-->
Understanding words or phrases uttered by others requires that we are able to 'translate' them terms into terms that we habitually use. While this is mostly an automatism, and it often is not necessary to be all that precise, this may be different when they relate to stuff we find important. The ability to refer to a specific %%concept|concept%% with a specific text or phrase, where this 'linking' is limited to a specific (or several) context(s) helps us to better interpret the intentsion of what others convey in spoken or written language.

### Criteria
<!--How is this concept different from related ideas? What are essential characteristics that must be true? This is where you specify the [intensional definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extensional_and_intensional_definitions) of the concept, i.e. the necessary and sufficient conditions for when the term should be used. This makes that the conceptomes crystal clear. In the case of nouns, this is equivalent to specifying the properties that an object needs to have in order to be counted as a referent of the term.-->
A Term MUST be a word or phrase that is linked to at least one %%context|scope%% and refers to precisely one %%concept|concept%%. 

### Examples
<!--Provide a few sentences in which you give examples that obviously qualify as instances of `Term`, and that do NOT obviously qualify. Also, provide examples that are not (so) obvious, but help users to better understand its intension.-->

### Related Concepts
<!--Link to any %%concepts|concept%% that are similar but distinct, with a note about the relationship.-->

### Background
The %%terminology pattern|pattern-terminology%% provides an overview of how this concept fits in with related concepts.

### Use-cases
<!--This (optional) section specifies an (optional) introductory paragraph, and a level-3 (i.e. `###`) subsection for every use case it describes. Every such use-case SHOULD
- describe the situation/context of the use-case;
- show how to apply ``Term`` to/in that situation;
- shows the relevance of having ``Term`` for the use-case as opposed to not having it.-->

### Notes
<!--This (optional) section is the place to put anything for which there is no other good place to put it.-->
There is an important [distinction](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concept) between concepts and the (multitude of) terms (names, labels) that we need to be able to talk and reason (argue) about them. Please consider that

* different terms are used in different contexts for the same concept
* in different contexts, a single term may refer to different concepts
* to resolve terminological disputes, which usually are about the 'correct' meaning of a term, try to establish the criteria that the different participants use for the concept behind the term. That helps participants understand each others (different) positions, and provides a better basis for resolving the conflict.
