### Short Description

A **Governor** is a [role](@) that a [party](@) (better: [employee](@) of a specific [party](@)) performs asit [governs](governance@) a (coherent) set of [expectations](@) of that [party](@), within a particular focus.

Within [organizations](@), these [expectations] are typically [owned](@) by an organizational unit (which iself qualifies as a [party](@)), e.g. a board of directors or a department, and directed at other organizational units. These [expectations](@) may link arbitrary organizational units, not just up and down the organizational hierarchy, but also to units at the same organization level, or at other (arbitrary) locations in the hierarchy.

Every focus area, such as finance, security, (regulatory) compliance, etc. typically has its own [governance](@) process. This allows for the efficient assignment of [governors](governance@) to the [governance](@) process of a specific focal area, e.g. to [employees](@) that have relevant "domain knowledge" and background for running such processes.

Within the context of [SSI](self-sovereign-identity@), knowledge- and information [governance](@) is a particular topic, and part of the results that are to be created and maintained are the various [policies](@) that provide guidance to [employees](@) for executing (both design-time and runtime) [actions](@) that have some relation with [credentials](@).

We will use the phrase "`<topic>` governor", where `<topic>` is a placeholder for a particular topic/domain, to refer to the [governor](governance@) that will [govern](governance@) the [expectations](@) of a single [party](@) that pertain to that particular topic/domain. For example: "knowledge governor" refers to the [governor](governance@) [role](@) that [governs](governance@) the [expectations](@) of a single [party](@) that pertain to that its [knowledge](@). Similarly, we might use "quality governor", "security governor", etc.

### Purpose

In order to ensure that [expectations](@) (that a [party](@) has regarding acertain topic/domain) are being met, or revised if they cannot be met, it is necessary that the [party](@) can task [employees](@) that have relevant "domain knowledge" with running a governance-process for such [expectations](@), and hence fulfill the role we have called [governor](governance@)

### Criteria

A **Governor** is a [role](@) that a [party](@) (better: [employee](@) of a specific [party](@)) performs asit [governs](governance@) a (coherent) set of [expectations](@) of that [party](@), within a particular focus.
