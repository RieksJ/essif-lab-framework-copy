Explain that validation is not verification:
- verification (of data) is the process of determining whether or not what the data represents is in fact true (veracity).
- validation (of data) is the process of determining whether or not data can be used to base a decision on. For example, a liquor selling party may determine that if someone simply says (s)he is 18+, that is valid data for deciding whether or not to sell the liquor, regardless of whether or not that statement is true.

### Short Description
**Validation** (of data) is the act, by or on behalf of a %%party|party%%, of determining whether or not that data is valid to be used for some specific purpose(s) of that %%party|party%%. This determination can only be made after it has been determined that data has the correct structure (syntax), and conforms to other specifications that apply to its structure.

Data that has been validated is considered to be sufficiently true, accurate, real or justified (i.e.: 'verified' as defined by [Merriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/verify) or [Lexico (Oxford dictionary)](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/verify)) so that it can be used for the purpose(s) that it has been validated for.

This definition generalizes the definition of 'validation' as provided by [W3C VC](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#dfn-credential-validation): "The assurance that a [verifiable credential](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#dfn-verifiable-credentials) or a [verifiable presentation](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#dfn-verifiable-presentations) meets the needs of a [verifier](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#dfn-verifier) and other dependent stakeholders." The W3C VC specificatin considers validating verifiable credentials or verifiable presentations outside of its scope.

Note that validation is distinct from %%verification|verify%%. %%Verification|verify%% is a test on the structure of data, whereas validation tests the validity of such data for a particular (set of) purpose(s), which also has to do with meaning. Specifically, data that fails particular verification tests can still be valid for some purpose. For example, a passport that has recently expired may still be valid to identify its bearer. The converse may also be true: data that satisfies timeliness tests, e.g. hasn't expired yet, may still not be valid for for specific purposes. For example, in order to apply for a [Chinese (tourist) visa](http://www.china-embassy.org/eng/hzqz/zgqz/t84246.htm), the passport must not expire within 6 months of arrival in China.
