### Short Description
A **compliance-level** is a measure for stating how well a %%entity|entity%% conforms with a stated (set of) requirement(s).

Compliance-levels can be expressed in many forms, such as
- one of the first letters of 'Low', 'Medium', or 'High';
- a digit in the interval [1-_n_], where _n_ is usually 4, 5 or 9;
- a combination of digits (indicating the expected impact) and letters (indicating the assessed likelihood);
- a color, e.g. one of 'green', 'yellow' and/or 'organge, 'red';
- a combination of character representation (appealing to the conscious mind of the reader) and a color (appealing to its unconscious mind)
