### Short Description
A **colleague** is one of two or more (digital or non-digital) %%agents|agent%% that have the same %%principal|principal%% (on whose behalf they are executing an %action%).

The ability to determine whether or not two %actors% are %colleagues% is the most relevant at run-time, when they are actually doing things and hence qualify as %agents%. For example, a web-server that is conducting a %transaction% (of which its %principal% is one of two %participants%) would need to know that the (different) %agents% that it is communicating with (e.g., a wallet app (on a phone) and a secure storage service (in the cloud)) both have the same %principal%.

The case can be made
### Purpose
The ability to distinguish between (non) %colleagues% allows us to reason and communicate about the set of (digital and non-digital) %%actors|actor%% that are %%agents|agent%% for a **principal|principal%%. This is relevant in situations where different %%agents|agent%% excute %%actions|action%% in a single %%business transaction|transaction%% on behalf of the same %%principal|principal%%
