# Colleague


### Short Description

A **colleague** is one of two or more (digital or non-digital) [agents](@) that have the same [principal](@) (on whose behalf they are executing an [action](@)).

### Examples

Consider a traveler that uses her digital wallet to communicate her [identity](@) to an immigration officer. In order to decide whether or not to permit the traveler entrance to the country, it must establish that the traveler (as an [actor](@) that pushes the buttons of the digital wallet) and the digital wallet (i.e. the [actor](@) that communicates some [identity](@) data), work on behalf of one and the same [party](@), i.e. the traveler (as a [party](@)).

Another example is a customer that uses a chat application (her [agent](@)) to contact the support department of her life insurance to sort something out. As the chat progresses, the life insurance [agent](@) must obtain some sensitive health-data, for which the chat channel isn't appropriate. He requests the customer to use another means ([actor](@)) that is capable of setting up a [communications channel](communication-channel@) that is more secure so that she can use this other means as an [agent](@) to transmit her sensitive health data. In order to prevent health fraud, the life insurance [agent](@) must be capable of determining that both the other means are [agents](@) that share the same [principal](@), i.e. the customer.

### Purpose

The ability to distinguish between (non) [colleagues](@) allows us to reason and communicate about the set of (digital and non-digital) [actors](@) that are [agents](@) for a [principal](@). This is relevant in situations where different [agents](@) execute [actions](@) in a single [business transaction](transaction@) on behalf of the same [principal](@)
