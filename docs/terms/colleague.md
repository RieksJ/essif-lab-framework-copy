### Short Description
A **colleague** is one of two or more (digital or non-digital) %%agents|agent%% that have the same %%principal|principal%% (on whose behalf they are executing an %%action|action%%).

### Examples

Consider a traveller that uses her digital wallet to communicate her %%identity|identity%% to an immigration officer. In order to decide whether or not to permit the traveller entrance to the country, it must establish that the traveller (as an %%actor|actor%% that pushes the buttons of the digital wallet) and the digital wallet (i.e. the %%actor|actor%% that communicates some %%identity|identity%% data), work on behalf of one and the same %%party|party%%, i.e. the traveller (as a %%party|party%%).

Another example is a customer that uses a chat application (her %%agent|agent%%) to contact the support department of her life insurance to sort something out. As the chat progresses, the life insurance %%agent|agent%% must obtain some sensitive health-data, for which the chat channel isn't appropriate. He requests the customer to use another means (%%actor|actor%%) that is capable of setting up a %%communications channel|communication-channel%% that is more secure so that she can use this other means as an %%agent|agent%% to transmit her sensitive health data. In order to prevent health fraud, the life insurance %%agent|agent%% must be capable of determining that both the other means are %%agents|agent%% that share the same %%principal|principal%%, i.e. the customer.

### Purpose
The ability to distinguish between (non) %%colleagues|colleague%% allows us to reason and communicate about the set of (digital and non-digital) %%actors|actor%% that are %%agents|agent%% for a **principal|principal%%. This is relevant in situations where different %%agents|agent%% excute %%actions|action%% in a single %%business transaction|transaction%% on behalf of the same %%principal|principal%%
