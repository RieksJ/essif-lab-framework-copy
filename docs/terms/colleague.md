:::info Editor's note
A discussion should be held to decide whether or not the term 'agent' in the definition should be replaced with 'employee', the idea being that in natural language, a person is a colleague of another person not only if both are actually functioning as an agent, but also when they are not doing things on behalf of their (shared) employer.

### Short Description
A **colleague** is one of two or more (digital or non-digital) %%agents|agent%% that have the same %%principal|principal%%.
### Purpose
The ability to distinguish between (non) colleagues allows us to reason and communicate about the set of (digital and non-digital) %%actors|actor%% that are %%agents|agent%% for a **principal|principal%%. This is relevant in situations where different %%agents|agent%% excute %%actions|action%% in a single %%business transaction|transaction%% on behalf of the same %%principal|principal%%
