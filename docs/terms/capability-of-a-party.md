### Short Description

The ability of a [party](@) to ensure that certain results (that are typically associated with an [objective](@) of that [party](@)) are realized;


A **capability** (of a [party](@)) is the (named) combination of
1. the means of a specific [party](@) to get something done - in other words the means to ensure that certain results are realized (typically associated with an [objective](@) of that [party](@));
2. the [party's](@) [governance](@) process that creates and continually maintains the (business) [policies](@) for getting that something done, and
3. the [party's](@) mapping process that ensures that every [employee](@) that has a task in getting this something done has access to an (operational) [policy](@), and uses it to [comply](@) with these (business) [policies](@) whenever it executes [actions](@) in such tasks.

The name of a capability typically refers to a (set of) function(s) that stakeholders (e.g. architects, domain experts, business people, developers) can easily related to. In [SSI](@) contexts, names such as 'issuer capability', 'revocation capability' might appear.

The description of a capability (of a [party](@)) should specify
1. its name;
2. its scope, i.e.
  - the functions that define the 'getting something done';
  - the [capabilities](@) that are expected to be in place, and that the [party](@) relies on to function as specified;
3. the [expectations](@) that it needs to [govern](@) regarding the capability, e.g. towards:
  - the [parties](@) (e.g. service providers) that (operationally) supply the [capabilities](@) that the [party](@) itself relies on;
  - [employees](@) that are tasked with the creation and operational maintenance of the means that the [party](@) needs to dispose of (and that may rely on other [capabilities](@)) in order to have this capability.
4. the [expectations](@) that this [party](@) has towards [employees](@) that are tasked with the operational execution of (some of) these functions[^1].

[^1]: it is important that the [party](@) properly defines the scope of the [capability](@), and limits its [governance](@) to its[expectations](@) within that scope.

### Examples

Examples of capability-descriptions are given in the [conceptual architecture page](essifLab-fw-conceptual-architecture-framework#capabilities).
