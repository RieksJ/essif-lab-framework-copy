### Short Description
A **Community** is a %%party|party%%, consisting of at least two different %%parties|party%% (the members of the %%community|community%%) that seek to collaborate with each other so that each of them can achieve its individual %%objectives|objective%% more efficiently and/or effectively. As a %%party|party%%, the community sets its own %%objectives|objective%% that its members contribute to realizing, because the results thereof aim to facilitate their cooperation.

There is no fundamental difference between %%communities|community%% and other %%parties|party%% in the sense that they are all %%parties|party%% that set %%objectives|objective%% and %%produce|management%% and/or %%consume|governance%% associated results. However, the kind of %%objectives|objective%% of a %%community|community%% is expected to serve the cooperation of its members, facilitate their collaborations, and remove any obstacles thereto. A %%community|community%% serves its members as they seek to realize their individual %%objectives|objective%%.

Note however that this 'serving' implies that each of its members sufficiently contributes to the realization of the communities' %%objectives|objective%%. This may be at odds with that member realizing its own %%objectives|objective%%. A %%community|community%% would do well
- to have %%objectives|objective%% in place that support its members in handling such balancing acts,
- realize that its members are %%parties|party%%, i.e. are autonomous entities that the %%community|community%% cannot control, and from there
- %%manage the risks|risk-management%% of (some of) its members not contributing their share of the work.

Note that a single set of %%parties|party%% can constitute different communities, the difference becoming apparent in the different %%objectives|objective%% that the communities pursue, or by the fact that individual %%parties|party%% may join or leave one, but not the other community.

A community is a specialization of the more generic %%ecosystem|ecosystem%% in the sense that it is a %%party|party%% in its own right (which an ecosystem need not be), and it (actively) facilitates the cooperation between its members, whereas in non-community ecosystems, such cooperation is not actively planned or organized.

### Purpose
The purpose of having %%communities|community%% is to organize and optimize collaborations between %%parties|party%% that reduce their individual effort for realizing their individual %%objectives|objective%% to a greater extent than the effort they must put into contributing to the community.

### Criterion
A **Community%% is a %%party|party%%,
- that consists of at least two different %%parties|party%% (its members);
- that sets %%objectives|objective%% for realizing results that enable its members to achieve their individual %%objectives|objective%% more efficiently and/or effectively;
- whose members contribute to the realization of these %%objectives|objective%%.
