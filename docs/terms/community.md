### Short Description
A Community is an %%organization|organization%% that seeks to facilitate the cooperation between at least two %%parties|party%% based on interests that these %%parties|party%% share as each of them seeks to realize its own, individual %%objectives|objective%%.

### Purpose
The ability to distinguish between %%communities|community%% and other %%organizations|organization%%, which simply seek to realize their own %%objectives|objective%% without any (explicit) regard to the objectives of other %%parties|party%% is particularly relevant in decentralized contexts. The characteristic of centralized contexts seems to be that an %%organization|organization%% that seeks to facilitate cooperation between other parties has (and uses) an ability to force these parties into complying with rules, working-instructions, etc., which may or may not be aligned with the interests of each of these parties. Such organizations are usually referred to as 'authorities'.

In decentralized contexts, the assumption is that all %%parties|party%% are autonomous (self-sovereign), which means that whatever such parties do (not) do is outside the scope of control of an %%organization|organization%% that seeks to facilitate cooperation between such parties. Such organizations will have objectives the realization of which do take the objectives and interests of other %%parties|party%% into regard.

### Criterion
A Community is an %%organization|organization%% that has one or more %%objectives|objective%% that seeks to facilitate the cooperation between at least two %%parties|party%% based on interests that these %%parties|party%% share as each of them seeks to realize its own, individual %%objectives|objective%%.
