### Short Description

An **Employee (of a Party)** is a (human or non-human (digital)) [actor](@) for whom/which it is realistic that it might execute [actions](@) on behalf of a [party](@) (called the [employer](@) of that [actor](@)). Typically, (an [actor](@)) becoming an [employee](@) of a [party](@) is the result of its (successful) [onboarding](@) by that [party](@).

In practice, the term 'employee' often implies a [person](human-being@) that is [onboarded](onboarding@) by an [organization](@). In our way of thinking, however, this meaning is too limited. Here are some examples of [actors](@) that also qualify in the [role](@) of [employee](@):
- a [person](human-being@) (as an [actor](@)) is always an [employee](@) of itself (as a [party](@));
- a technical (digital) component ([actor](@)) that is [controlled](scope-of-control@) by a [party](@) (implying that it is also [onboarded](onboarding@)), also qualifies as an [employee](@) of that [party](@).
- any [actor](@) (human or non-human) that is [mandated](mandate@) for executing certain [actions](@) on behalf of some [party](@), qualifies as an [employee](@) of that [party](@).

The [Parties, Actors and Actions pattern](pattern-party-actor-action@) provides an overview of how this concept fits in with related concepts.
