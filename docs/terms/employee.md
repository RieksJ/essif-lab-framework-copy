### Short Description

An **Employee (of a Party)** is a (human or non-human) %%actor|actor%% for whom/which it is realistic that it might execute %%actions|action%% on behalf of a %%party|party%% (called the %%employer|employer%% of that %%actor|actor%%). Typically, that would be the result of its (successful) %%onboarding|onboarding%% by that %%party|party%%.

In practice, the term 'employee' often implies a %%person|human-being%% that is %%onboarded|onboarding%% by an %%organization|organization%%. In our way of thinking, however, this meaning is too limited. Here are some examples of %%actors|actor%% that also qualify in the %%role|role%% of %%employee|employee%%:
- a %%person|human-being%% (as an %%actor|actor%%) is always an %%employee|employee%% of itself (as a %%party|party%%);
- a technical component (%%actor|actor%%) that is %%controlled|scope-of-control%% by a %%party|party%% (implying that it is also %%onboarded|onboarding%%), also qualifies as an %%employee|employee%% of that %%party|party%%.
- any %%actor|actor%% (human or non-human) that is %%mandated|mandate%% for executing certain %%actions|action%% on behalf of some %%party|party%%, qualifies as an %%employee|employee%% of that %%party|party%%.

The %%Parties, Actors and Actions pattern|pattern-party-actor-action%% provides an overview of how this concept fits in with related concepts.
