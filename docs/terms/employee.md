### Short Description

An **Employee (of a Party)** is a (human or non-human) %%actor|actor%% for whom/which it is realistic that it might execute %%actions|action%% on behalf of a %%party|party%% (called the %%employer|employer%% of that %%actor|actor%%). Typically, that would be the result of its (successful) %%onboarding|onboarding%% by that %%party|party%%.

In practice, the term 'employee' often implies a %person% that is %onboarded% by an %organization%. In our way of thinking, however, this meaning is too limited. Here are some examples of %actors% that also qualify in the %role% of %employee%:
- a %person% (as an %actor%) is always an %employee% of itself (as a %party%);
- a technical component (%actor%) that is %controlled|scope-of-control% by a %party% (implying that it is also %onboarded%), also qualifies as an %employee% of that %party%.
- any %actor% (human or non-human) that is %mandated% for executing certain %actions% on behalf of some %party%, qualifies as an %employee% of that %party%.

The %%Parties, Actors and Actions pattern|pattern-party-actor-action%% provides an overview of how this concept fits in with related concepts.
