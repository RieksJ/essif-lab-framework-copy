### Short Description
A **commitment decision** (of a %%party|party%% in a %%business transaction|transaction%%) is the decision of that %%party|party%% whether or not to commit to that %%business transaction|transaction%%, i.e. (promise) to fulfill the %%obligations|obligation%% that the associated %%transaction agreement proposal|transaction-proposal%% would impose on that %%party|party%% once it were signed.

In the [*DEMO*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_%26_Engineering_Methodology_for_Organizations) transaction model, this decision either leads to the canceling of the transaction (if either %%party|party%% decides not to commit), or to the execution of the transaction (if both %%parties|party%% have decided to commit).

Typically, a %%party|party%% will decide to commit if all of the following conditions are met:
1. the %%party|party%% knows what it is expected to do, and what it will get in return;
2. the %%party|party%% assesses the cost of the %%transaction|transaction%% to be lower than its benefits (there is a net profit);
3. the %%risks|risk%% that the %%party|party%% perceives to be associated with the %%transaction|transaction%% (once committed to) are acceptable.

The relevance of this for SSI is that these conditions are the sources for the party's information (%%data|data%%) need, and determine the answers to questions such as:
- what %%data|data%% do I need from what %%kinds of credentials|credential-type%% so that I can make this decision?
- what assurances need to come with the %%data so that it qualifies|qualified-data%% as valid for making this decision?
The answers to these questions are relevant for a party's ability to formulate a %%(presentation) request|presentation-request%%.
