### Short Description
An **SSI-agent** is a [digital agent](agent@) that provides one or more of the SSI functionalities (i.e. [issuer](@), [holder](@), [verifier](@), [wallet](@)) to its [principal](@).

### Purpose

The ability to distinguish between (non)SSI agents allows us to exclusively talk about agents that provide some or all of the SSI functionalities (i.e. [issuer](@), [holder](@), [verifier](@), [wallet](@)).

See also: [digital agent](agent@), and [agent](@).
