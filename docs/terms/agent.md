## Short Description
An %%Actor|actor%% that is executing on action on behalf of some %%Party|party%%, which means that the execution of that action is subject to the conditions and other guidance set by that Party, then we say the Actor acts as an Agent of that Party. A Person, that is both an Actor and a Party can hence be seen as its own Agent. Agency is further detailed in the ['Party-Action' pattern|pattern-party-action].

## Criterion:
%%Actor|actor%% that is momentarily executing an action on behalf of a %%Party|party%%.

## Examples:

- A person that is 'doing its own things' acts as an Agent for himself.
- A person that does things for his employer acts as an Agent for that employer.
- An ambassador, when (s)he is 'in function', acts as an Agent for the country for which (s)he is ambassador.
- A person that fills in the tax return form for someone else acts as an Agent for this someone else.
- A company that makes cars may use robots that weld parts of a car together; these robots acts as Agents for that company.
- A (running) webserver that accepts product orders for a retailer acts as a (digital) Agent for that retailer.
