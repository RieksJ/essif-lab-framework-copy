# Role name

### Short Description

A **Role name** is a name by which a [role](@) can be referred to, and which [identifies](identifier@) that [role](@) in contexts in which it is used. Accordingly, using it without properly referencing the context may cause misunderstandings, as role names refer to different [roles](@) in different contexts.

A role name is also used to refer to an (arbitrary) [entity](@) that performs the [role](@) that the role name actually refers to. For example if 'issuer' is a role-name for [entities](@). For example, the role name '[Agent](@)' is used to generically refer to an (arbitrary) [actor](@) that is executing some [action](@) on behalf of a [party](@).
