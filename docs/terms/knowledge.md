# Knowledge


### Short Description

**Knowledge** is the (intangible) sum of what is known, the familiarity, awareness or understanding of someone or something ([WikiPedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge)). It includes facts ([propositional knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propositional_knowledge)), skills ([procedural knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_knowledge)), or objects ([acquaintance knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_by_acquaintance)). Knowledge can be acquired in many different ways and from many different sources, including but not limited to experience, reason, memory, testimony, scientific inquiry, education, and practice.

We limit the scope of a [knowledge](@) to a [party](@) so as to allow for the existence of multiple such [knowledges](@), where each of them is internally consistent, yet may be inconsistent with other [knowledges](@).

### Purpose

We need a term to refer to the (intangible) sum of what is known, the familiarity, awareness or understanding of someone or something of a [party](@), because this is what allows the [party](@) to reason, and make decisions. When a [party](@) can successfully share (parts of) its knowledge, i.e. communicate it such that when another [party](@) interpret it, the intension is preserved, mutual understanding is achieved, which is prerequisite for doing [business transactions](transaction@) and/or collaborating.

### Criterion

The intangible sum of what is known to some [party](@), as well as the familiarity, awareness or understanding of someone or something by that [party](@).

### Notes

- 'A knowledge' is 1-1 associated with a [party](@) (in a way, each knowledge defines that [party](@)).
- a knowledge includes the rules that its [party](@) has decided constitutes valid [Logics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic) (i.e. rules for reasoning). Such logics are usually not [formal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_system), or [mathematical logics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_logic).
- In order for reasoning with, or transferring Knowledge, it must be made explicit, e.g. in writing, speech, digitally or otherwise. The mapping of knowledge onto such representations is called '[semantics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantics)'. Every [party](@) determines which semantics it chooses to use.
