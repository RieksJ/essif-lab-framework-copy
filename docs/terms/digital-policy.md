### Short Description
A **digital policy** is an artifact that is derived from, and represents, a %%policy|policy%% for the purpose of being useable in the digital realm.

### Purpose

The ability to distinguish between (non)digital policies allows us to exclusively talk about machine-readable policies, i.e. policies that are to be used by harsoftware/hardware %%actors|actor%%.
