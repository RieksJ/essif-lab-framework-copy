### Short Description
**Risk management** is a process that is run by (or on behalf of) a specific %%party|party%% for the purpose of %%managing|management%% the %%risks|risk%% that it %%owns|owner%% (thereby realizing specific %%risk objectives|risk-objective%%). The overall %%risk objective|risk-objective%% that %%parties|party%% seek to %%manage|management%% is to ensure that the set of all %%risks|risk%% that they perceive to run are, as a whole, acceptable.

For various purposes, a %%party|party%% may decide to run multiple %%risk management|risk-management%% processes. For example, it may run one process for %%managing|management%% the %%risks|risk%% related to quality, or information security, or environmental issues. This allows a %%party|party%% to design, maintain and realize %%risk objectives|risk-objective%% that are tailored to such topics. Also, a %%party|party%% may run different %%risk management|risk-management%% processes (perhaps with the same %%risk objectives|risk-objective%%) for different parts of its %%scope of control|scope-of-control%%. However, a %%party|party%% should ensure that the combination of these processes result in its overall %%risk management|risk-management%% to be complete, coherent and consistent.

For the %%risk management|risk-management%% of a %%party|party%% to be *complete*, it must (explicitly or implicitly) define and maintain a set of %%risk objectives|risk-objective%%, such that when every of these %%objectives|objective%% has been realized, the remaining (residual) %%risks|risk%% (associated with the set of all %%objectives|objective%% %%owned|owned%% by this %%party|party%%) is, as a whole, acceptable. One %%risk objective|risk-objective%% of a %%party|party%% was mentioned in the previous paragraph (i.e. that the overall %%risk management|risk-management%% should be complete, coherent and consistent"). Other well-known objectives are that %%risk management|risk-management%% should be certifiable against some standard, e.g. ISO 9001 for quality, ISO 27001 for information security, or ISO 14001 for environmental risks.

For the %%risk management|risk-management%% of a %%party|party%% to be *coherent*, any %%risk management|risk-management%% process that it runs (or has outsourced) will only take %%risks|risk%% into account for %%objectives|objective%% that are %%owned|owned%% by that %%party|party%%. This can easily be explained by observing that both the %%objectives|objective%% and (associated) %%risks|risk%% should be managed within the context of a single %%knowledge|knowledge%%, being that of their %%owner|owner%%. Also, given that %%parties|party%% are autonomous, they can only %%manage|management%% what is their own %%scope of control|scope-of-control%%.

For the %%risk management|risk-management%% of a %%party|party%% to be *consistent*, it must ensure that the %%risk management|risk-management%% detects signals that indicate a change in the risks, e.g. signals that detect:
- a change in %%risk level|risk-level%% of an existing %%objective|objective%%;
- an %%objective|objective%% that is being added to, modified within, or deleted from the set of %%objectives|objective%% whose associated %%risks|risk%% the process %%manages|management%%;
- a change in the set of %%risk objectives|risk-objective%% that the process pursues.

We distinguish between the following kinds of risk-management:
- **centralized risk-management**, which is a kind of %%risk management|risk-management%% that assumes that the %%party|party%% that runs it has the power or right to give orders, make decisions that other parties must follow, and enforce obedience, which can be applied to mitigate its %%risks|risk%%. This kind of risk-management ignores the natural autonomy of other %%parties|party%%, and hence may have consequences that the %%party|party%% cannot %%control|controller%%.
- **decentralized or networked risk-management**, which is a kind of %%risk management|risk-management%% that assumes that the %%party|party%% that runs it acknowledges the autonomy of other %%parties|party%% to determine their own %%objectives|objective%% and %%manage|management%% the associated %%risks|risk%% as they see fit. This implies that this %%party|party%% will communicate with these other %%parties|party%% about their mutual %%expectations|expectation%%, and find ways that help each other to manage their individual, subjective %%risks|risk%%.

### Purpose
The purpose of a **Risk Management** process (that is run by, or on behalf of, some %%party|party%%), is to manage the %%risks|risk%% that it %%owns|owner%% within its %%scope of control|scope-of-control%%. This may entail helping its stakeholders, i.e. the %%parties|party%% that either produce or consume the results of %%objectives|objective%% that this %%party|party%% owns, to %%manage|management%% their %%risks|risk%% as well.

### Criterion
A Risk Management (process) is a set of related %%activities|action%% that a %%party|party%% runs for the purpose of realizing a set of %%risk objectives|risk-objective%% that it %%owns|owner%%, where the realization of these %%risk objectives|risk-objective%% ensure that (a specific subset of) the set of all %%objectives|objective%% that the %%party|party%% %%owns|owner%% come with associated %%risks|risk%% that, on the whole, this %%party|party%% finds acceptable.
