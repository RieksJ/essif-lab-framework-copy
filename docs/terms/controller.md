### Short Description
An **Controller** of an %%entity|entity%% is the role that an %%actor|actor%% performs as it is executing actions on that %%entity|entity%% for the purpose of ensuring that the %%entity|entity%% will act/behave, or be used, in a particular way. Thus, a controller controls the behaviour and/or use of the %%entity|entity%% it controls.

Being a controller of an %%entity|entity%% does *not* imply
- %%ownership|ownership%% of that %%entity|entity%%,
- having a (legitimate) right, duty or authorization for executing actions that control the %%entity|entity%%.

See also %%controllership|controllership%%.

### Purpose
The ability to distinguish between (non)controllers of an %%entity|entity%% enables us to %%identify|identify%% the %%actors|actor%% that can make sure that the %%entity|entity%% acts/behaves, or will be used, in a particular way. It also helps %%owners|owner%% of that %%entity|entity%% to manage rights (or duties) to execute controller-actions to %%actors|actor%%.

### Criteria
An %%actor|actor%% is said to be a **controller** of some %%entity|entity%% if and only if it is executing an action on that %%entity^entity%% for the purpose of ensuring that the %%entity^entity%% will act/behave, or be used, in a particular way.

### Notes
The [*GDPR*](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32016R0679&from=EN) (Article 4(7)) defines 'controller' as the party that determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data, which is different from how we defined it. The GDPR 'processor' (Article 4(8)), i.e. that processes personal data on behalf of a (GDPR-)controller, would (in our terms) control that personal data and hence qualify as controller.
