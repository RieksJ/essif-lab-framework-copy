### Short Description

A **capability** (of a %%party|party%%) is the (named) combination of
1. the means of a specific %%party|party%% to get something done - in other words the means to ensure that certain results are realized (typically associated with an %%objective|objective%% of that %%party|party%%);
2. the %%party's|party%% %%governance|governance%% process that ensures that its (business) %%policies|policy%% for getting that something done are being created and maintained, and
3. the %%party's|party%% %%management|management%% process that creates and maintains the (operational) %%policies|policy%%, such that every %%employee|employee%% that has a task in getting this something done can find and interpret a %%policy|policy%% and use it as it executes %%actions|action%% in such tasks..

The name of a capability typically refers to a (set of) function(s) that stakeholders (e.g. architects, domain experts, business people, developers) can easily relate to. In %%SSI|self-sovereign-identity%% contexts, names such as 'issuer capability', 'revocation capability' might appear.

The description of a capability (of a %%party|party%%) should specify
1. its name;
2. its scope, i.e.
  - the functions that define the 'getting something done';
  - the (other) %%capabilities|capability%% that are expected to be in place, and that the %%party|party%% relies on to function as specified;
3. the %%expectations|expectation%% that the %%party|party%% needs to %%govern|governance%% regarding the capability, e.g. towards:
  - the %%parties|party%% (e.g. service providers) that (operationally) supply the %%capabilities|capability%% that the %%party|party%% itself relies on;
  - %%employees|employee%% that are tasked with the creation and operational maintenance of the means that the %%party|party%% needs to dispose of (and that may rely on other %%capabilities|capability%%) in order to have this capability.
4. the %%expectations|expectation%% that this %%party|party%% has towards %%employees|employee%% that are tasked with the operational execution of (some of) these functions[^1].

[^1]: it is important that the %%party|party%% properly defines the scope of the %%capability|capability%%, and limits its %%governance|governance%% to its%%expectations|expectation%% within that scope.

### Examples

We need a set of references towards good examples of capability-descriptions.
