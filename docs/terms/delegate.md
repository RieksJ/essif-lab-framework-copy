### Short Description
A **delegate** is the transferral of %%ownership|ownership%% of one or more %%obligations|obligation%% of a %%party|party%% (the %%delegator|delegate%%), including the associated accountability, to another %%party|party%% (the %%delegatee|delegate%%), including the associated accountability, to another %%party|party%% (the %%delegatee|delegate%%), which implies that the %%delegatee|delegate%% can realize such %%obligations|obligation%% as it sees fit. This also implies that, since the results associated with the %%obligation|obligation%% are consumed by others (third %%parties|party%%), they should be/remain fit for the purpose(s) that these other %%parties|party%% need them to serve.

The transferral of %%ownership|ownership%% of an %%obligation|obligation%% differs from having a %%party|party%% produce the expected results as in the latter case, the %%governance|governance%% of the %%obligation|obligation%% is not transferred.

Delegates are subject to the %%legal system|legal-system%% of a %%jurisdiction|jurisdiction%%, which has the rules and constraints that specify what can(not) be done with them. Thus, %%delegated|delegate%% %%obligations|obligation%% are duties that are enforced using the means that its %%jurisdiction|jurisdiction%% applies for that. The same goes in case of conflicts that concern %%delegates|delegate%%. Also, %%jurisdictions|jurisdiction%% may themselves specify %%delegates|delegate%%, or templates for %%delegates|delegate%% that e.g. only require the %%delegator|delegate%% and %%delegatee(s)|delegate%% to be filled in.

<!-- As explained (see the %%duties and rights pattern|pattern-duties-and-rights%%), rights and duties are relations between %%legal entities|legal-entity%%: %%parties|party%% have rights/duties *towards* others. For example, a %%party|party%% that is holder of a bank account has a right (that it can exercize) towards the bank to transfer money out of the account, which implies that the bank has a corresponding duty to enable that %%party|party%% to exercize that right. This makes that it is not trivial to operationalize delegates: simply creating a %%delegate|delegate%% by the %%delegator|delegate%% does not mean that the %%party|party%% that has the corresponding duties and/or rights can recognize them as being authentic, or can handle them. This is particularly an issue when verifying the authenticity and subsequent handling are to be done electronically. -->

### Purpose
The purpose of (formal and/or explicit) %%delegates|delegate%% is that it enables %%parties|party%% to establish whether or not %%parties|party%% that have (a) specific %%action(s)|action%% executed, are entitled to do so.
### Criterion
A **delegate** is the transferral of %%ownership|ownership%% of one or more %%obligations|obligation%% of a %%party|party%% (the %%delegator|delegate%%), including the associated accountability, to another %%party|party%% (the %%delegatee|delegate%%), including the associated accountability, to another %%party|party%% (the %%delegatee|delegate%%), which implies that the %%delegatee|delegate%% can realize such %%obligations|obligation%% as it sees fit.

### Examples


### Notes

The main difference between a %%mandate|mandate%% and a %%delegate|delegate%% is that under a %%mandate|mandate%%, responsibility/accountability is not transferred to the %%mandatee|mandate%%, whereas under a %%delegate|delegate%% the responsibility/accountability is also transferred.
