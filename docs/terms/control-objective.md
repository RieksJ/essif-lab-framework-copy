### Short Description
A **control objective** is an %%objective|objective%%, owned by a %%party|party%%, that aims to contribute to the realization of another (set of) %%objective(s)|objective%% of that %%party|party%%, by producing results that this %%party|party%% needs to realize these other %objective(s). A control objective has the property that it is both %%managed|management%% (as it produces specific results) and also %%governed|governance%% (as it uses these results - as a contribution to the realization of other objectives of that %%party|party%%) by (or on behalf of) its %%owner|owner%%.

The %%governance|governance%% aspect entails the specification of the results that are needed, and the characteristics that they should have in order to be a useful and relevant contribution for the %%objective|objective%% for which it is a control.  as a realization

Typical contributions for a control objective is the production of an intermediate result, the mitigation of a specific risk, or results that contribute to the realization of %%compliance objectives|compliance-objective%%.

There are various ways for %%parties|party%% to come to grips with specifying and %%managing|management%% their %%control objectives|control-objective%%. Here are some examples:

- %%Organizations|organization%% (specifially those with a rather large %%scope of control|scope-of-control%%) are known to classify their (regular) %%objectives|objective%% according to (business) topics such as finance, (information) security, safety, quality, legal, human resources etc. This allows them to specify %%control objectives|control-objective%% that are particular to such topics, and define equally specific control %%management|management%% processes for that.
- %%Organizations|organization%% that realize that their departments (and sub-departments) are actually %%parties|party%% that each have their %%own|owner%% set of %%objectives|objective%%, may require such departments to specify their own %%control objectives|control-objective%% and associated control %%management|management%% process(es). This enables such %%organizations|organization%% to specify %%control objectives|control-objective%% that (only) seek assurances that their departments are properly specifying their own %%objectives|objective%%, and %%manage|management%% the associated %%controls|controller%%.
- %%Organizations|organization%% are also known to create %%control objectives|control-objective%% that fit traditional control %%management|management%% processes, e.g. as defined in ISO standards.
- %%Organizations|organization%% may classify their %%objectives|objective%% using the [formalization of objectives](./objective#formalization) (and the %%governance and management pattern|pattern-governance-and-management%%), e.g.
  - expectations, i.e. %%objectives|objective%% the result of which is consumed, but not produced by the %%organization|organization%%. Such %%objectives|objective%% are not %%managed|management%% but %%governed|governance%%, and hence require a corresponding control %%management|management%% process;
  - obligations, i.e. %%objectives|objective%% the result of which is produced by the %%organization|organization%% and consumed by (at least) one other %%party|party%%. Such %%objectives|objective%% are %%managed|management%%, and also require communication with the consuming %%parties|party%%;
  - controls, i.e. %%objectives|objective%% the result of which is produced and (only) consumed by the %%organization|organization%% itself. These %%objectives|objective%% must be %%managed|management%% and %%governed|governance%% by the %%party|party%% that %%owns|owner%% them.

We have observed that (the %%management|management%% of) the %%controls|controller%% associated with the %%objectives|objective%% that control %%management|management%% processes pursue themselves, are often 'forgotten', i.e. these %%objectives|objective%% are not in the scope of any control %%management|management%% process. %%Parties|party%% should set %%control objectives|control-objective%% that aim to mitigate the %%controls|controller%% associated with (the %%objectives|objective%% pursued by) their control %%management|management%% procesess.

Control objectives should also be associated with %%assessment frameworks|assessment-framework%% that auditors will use for determining the %%control-levels|control-level%% for each of these objectives.

### Purpose
The purpose of control-objectives is help %%parties|party%% determine and prioritize the work they need to do in order to ensure that the %%controls|controller%% they run become, and/or remain, acceptable.

### Criteria
A %%control-objective|control-objective%% is an %%objective|objective%% that
- is associated with one or more (classes of) %%objectives|objective%% that are controlled by the %%owner|owner%% of the %%control-objective|control-objective%%;
- is associated with one or more %%normative frameworks|normative-framework%% that these (classes of) %%objectives|objective%% are to comply with;
- may be associated with appropriate %%assessment frameworks|assessment-framework%% that auditors must use to determine the %%level of control|control-level%%.
