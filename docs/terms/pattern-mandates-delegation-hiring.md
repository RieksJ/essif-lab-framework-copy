:::info Editor's note
This is work that is being envisaged.
:::

The idea here is to observe that:
- [mandating](mandate@) and [delegating](delegate@) are the same except for the transfer of accountability for the transferred actions;
- the differences with guardianship seems to be not all that big, so we may see a merge with that model;
- ownership (as defined in the [party-actor-action pattern](pattern-party-actor-action@)) can possibly be made part of this, too.
