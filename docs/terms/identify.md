### Short Description
**Identification** of an %%entity|entity%% is the act, by or on behalf of a  %%party|party%%, of selecting one %%entity|entity%% from a set of %%entities|entity%%. For example, in a court of law, a witness can be asked to identify the person that caused the mischief, i.e. select that person from the set of people that are present. As another example, when a user logs into a computer system, this system needs to identify the the user's account, i.e. select that account from all other accounts.

It is a common practice to use %%identifiers|identifier%% for identification purposes. For example, a username typically serves to identify a user account. However, %%identifiers|identifier%% do not necessarily have the property of (always) identifying some entity. For example, the identifier 'localhost' would identify a web server on your laptop computer, but in the context of other computers it would identify other web servers. Also, in the context of war planes, 'B52' would identify a specific kind of [bomber plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_B-52%27s), while in the context of some airports (e.g. [Amsterdam Schiphol Airport](https://foursquare.com/v/position-b52/4e270f7818380c0d4dfd15b7/photos)), it identifies a gate. In other contexts, it would represent some [kind of cocktail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-52_(cocktail)).

Identification can also be a process in which the parth collects characteristics (attributes) of an entity to the extent that there is only one entity (in the set of all entities that it knows to exist) that has all of them. For example, if you phone your insurance company to file a claim, you need to provide characteristics that enable the the company's employee to find the policy (if it exists at all) under which the claim must be serviced. It may suffice to provide the name of the insured person, e.g. if it is a not too common name, and the person has a single insurance policy with the company. If it is a common name, another attribute such as date of birth may be required. If the person has multiple policies, the kind of policy must be provided.
