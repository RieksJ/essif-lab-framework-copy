### Short Description
The **Mission** or **[Mission Statement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mission_statement)** of a [party](@) is an [objective](@) of that [party](@) in which it states why it exists, what its overall goal is - the goal of its operations.

A mission is both an [obligation](@) (of that [party](@) towards itself) and an [expectation](@) (of that [party](@) towards itself).
