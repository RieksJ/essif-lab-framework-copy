### Short Description
An **Obligation** is an %%objective|objective%% that is %%owned|owned%% by the %%party|party%% that produces the associated results, and that has a commitment to another %%party|party%% that consumes these results.

In the figure below, %%objectives|objective%% Obj-1 is an %%obligations|obligation%% of Red towards Yellow. Also, %%objective|objective%% Obj-Grn-k is an %%obligation|obligation%% of Green towards Red.

*Figure 1: Chained Objectives - results produced in one objective are consumed in another*

The figure shows four %%parties|party%% (Red, Yellow, Blue and Green) and their associated %%scopes of control|scope-of-control%%. Within these, they %%own|owner%% the %%objectives|objective%% (the figure shows 6 %%objectives|objective%% owned by red and one for each of the other %%parties|party%%). The figure in the top right hand corner of the rectangle that represents an %%objective|objective%%, is the %%party|party%% that the %%owner|owner%% of the %%objective|objective%% expects to produce the %%objective's|objective%% results. It is not necessary that such a %%party|party%% is known all the time (e.g. %%objective|objective%% Obj-1a).

The arrows indicate that results produced to realize a certain %%objective|objective%% (at the source of the arrow) are (to be) used to produce the results of another %%objective|objective%% (at the end/tip of the arrow).

For more information, e.g. about how different %%parties|party%% interact in their roles of producer and consumer, we refer you to the %%Governance and Management pattern|pattern-governance-and-management%%.
