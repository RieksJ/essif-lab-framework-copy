## Purpose
<!--Concisely describe what can you do with the pattern that is (at least) harder if you didn't have it.-->
This pattern captures the foundational concepts and relations that we need for thinking about people (human beings), organizations, and how they interact with one another in a decentralized, self-sovereign way - which means that each of them decides for itself whether or not to interact with others, how to conduct such interactions, etc., thereby only taking external influences into account if they want, or have some need to do so.

## Introduction
<!--Gently introduce the pattern, by referring to real-world situations and using colloquial terms, so that when someone has read the text, (s)he knows what it is about, and is ready to delve into the specifics of the pattern-->
TL;DR: This pattern models that <Term popup="Entity that has knowledge about what exists, ways to reason with that knowledge, and ways for making decisions in a Self-Sovereign fashion." reference="Party">Parties</Term> (humans, organizations) perform <Term popup="something that is done by an actor" reference="Action">Actions</Term> for the purpose of realizing their <Term popup="undefined" reference="Objective">Objectives</Term>. <Term popup="Entity that has knowledge about what exists, ways to reason with that knowledge, and ways for making decisions in a Self-Sovereign fashion." reference="Party">Parties</Term> are not considered to actually execute such <Term popup="something that is done by an actor" reference="Action">Actions</Term>; they have (human and non-human) <Term popup="Entity that can act (do things), e.g. people, machines, but not organizations." reference="Actor">Actors</Term> that work for them, execute such <Term popup="something that is done by an actor" reference="Action">Actions</Term>, using the <Term popup="Entity that has knowledge about what exists, ways to reason with that knowledge, and ways for making decisions in a Self-Sovereign fashion." reference="party">Party</Term>’s <Term popup="knowledge popover text" reference="knowledge">Knowledge</Term> as the (authoritative) guidance for executing the <Term popup="something that is done by an actor" reference="Action">Actions</Term> (as well as any other relevant <Term popup="knowledge popover text" reference="knowledge">Knowledge</Term> they can access).

The essential characteristic of <Term popup="Entity that has knowledge about what exists, ways to reason with that knowledge, and ways for making decisions in a Self-Sovereign fashion." reference="Party">Parties</Term> is their 1-1 link with <Term popup="knowledge popover text" reference="knowledge">Knowledge</Term>, which they continually update and use e.g. for reasoning, decision making, and determining e.g. what to do, when, and with whom. <Term popup="knowledge popover text" reference="knowledge">Knowledge</Term> not only includes (observable) facts, but also opinions, e.g. regarding the <Term popup="something that is done by an actor" reference="Entity">Entities</Term> it knows to exist, relations between them, and rules (constraints, [logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic)[^1]) that can be used to classify and reasoning about them, and for making decisions. 

Perhaps the most important idea in this pattern is that our <Term popup="Entity that has knowledge about what exists, ways to reason with that knowledge, and ways for making decisions in a Self-Sovereign fashion." reference="party">Party</Term> concept is not considered to (be able to) act, and they need <Term popup="Entity that can act (do things), e.g. people, machines, but not organizations." reference="Actor">{{Actors</Term>:Actor}} (i.e. <Term popup="something that is done by an actor" reference="Entity">Entities</Term> that _can_ act) to act on their behalf and thus make them perform. This does, however,  not preclude having <Term popup="something that is done by an actor" reference="Entity">Entities</Term> that are both <Term popup="Entity that has knowledge about what exists, ways to reason with that knowledge, and ways for making decisions in a Self-Sovereign fashion." reference="party">Party</Term> and <Term popup="Entity that can act (do things), e.g. people, machines, but not organizations." reference="actor">Actor</Term> - e.g. humans - and that such <Term popup="something that is done by an actor" reference="Entity">Entities</Term> can act on their ‘own’ behalf. And we can continue to use the commonly used form of speech in which a <Term popup="Entity that has knowledge about what exists, ways to reason with that knowledge, and ways for making decisions in a Self-Sovereign fashion." reference="party">Party</Term> performs some Action  by realizing that this means that there is (at least) one <Term popup="Entity that can act (do things), e.g. people, machines, but not organizations." reference="actor">Actor</Term> that is actually executing that %%Action%%.

In this pattern, <Term popup="knowledge popover text" reference="knowledge">Knowledge</Term> takes center stage. <Term popup="knowledge popover text" reference="knowledge">Knowledge</Term> contains <Term popup="undefined" reference="Objective">Objectives</Term> to be realized and managed. This not only triggers all sorts of <Term popup="something that is done by an actor" reference="Action">Actions</Term> to be performed, but also guides their execution in terms of when an Action should start, when it terminates, which <Term popup="Entity that can act (do things), e.g. people, machines, but not organizations." reference="Actor">Actors</Term> qualify for executing it, etc. Everything that is specific for a <Term popup="Entity that has knowledge about what exists, ways to reason with that knowledge, and ways for making decisions in a Self-Sovereign fashion." reference="party">Party</Term> is reflected in its <Term popup="knowledge popover text" reference="knowledge">Knowledge</Term>.

This works well for human beings, which are both a <Term popup="Entity that has knowledge about what exists, ways to reason with that knowledge, and ways for making decisions in a Self-Sovereign fashion." reference="party">Party</Term> and an <Term popup="Entity that can act (do things), e.g. people, machines, but not organizations." reference="actor">Actor</Term>. So a human being can act, implying itself as an <Term popup="Entity that can act (do things), e.g. people, machines, but not organizations." reference="actor">Actor</Term>, and using its personal <Term popup="knowledge popover text" reference="knowledge">Knowledge</Term> as guidance. The model also works when a human being (as a <Term popup="Entity that has knowledge about what exists, ways to reason with that knowledge, and ways for making decisions in a Self-Sovereign fashion." reference="party">Party</Term>) may hire someone else (as an <Term popup="Entity that can act (do things), e.g. people, machines, but not organizations." reference="actor">Actor</Term>), e.g. to fill in his tax return form. This other is guided by the <Term popup="knowledge popover text" reference="knowledge">Knowledge</Term> of the human being that hired him, and uses its own <Term popup="knowledge popover text" reference="knowledge">Knowledge</Term> for the details of filling in the tax form.

It also works well for organizations, which are typically companies, enterprises, governments or parts thereof, i.e. groups of human beings and possibly other <Term popup="Entity that can act (do things), e.g. people, machines, but not organizations." reference="Actor">Actors</Term> that, as a group, fit the criteria for being a <Term popup="Entity that has knowledge about what exists, ways to reason with that knowledge, and ways for making decisions in a Self-Sovereign fashion." reference="party">Party</Term>. This group of <Term popup="Entity that can act (do things), e.g. people, machines, but not organizations." reference="Actor">Actors</Term> would typically work to realize the organization’s <Term popup="undefined" reference="Objective">Objectives</Term>, being guided by the organization’s <Term popup="knowledge popover text" reference="knowledge">Knowledge</Term> (registrations, policies, etc.). Like human beings, an organization may (have an appropriate <Term popup="Entity that can act (do things), e.g. people, machines, but not organizations." reference="actor">Actor</Term>) decide to hire or fire <Term popup="Entity that can act (do things), e.g. people, machines, but not organizations." reference="Actor">Actors</Term> for longer or shorter periods.

<Term popup="Entity that has knowledge about what exists, ways to reason with that knowledge, and ways for making decisions in a Self-Sovereign fashion." reference="Party">Parties</Term> set <Term popup="undefined" reference="Objective">Objectives</Term> that they seek to achieve, the most basic of which perhaps is its mission, or its ‘raison d'être’, to the realization of which all of its <Term popup="something that is done by an actor" reference="Action">Actions</Term> are (ultimately) aimed. Every Objective is owned by a single <Term popup="Entity that has knowledge about what exists, ways to reason with that knowledge, and ways for making decisions in a Self-Sovereign fashion." reference="party">Party</Term> (we do not consider ‘shared objectives’[^2]).
