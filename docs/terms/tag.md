### Short Description
A Tag is an alphanumeric string that is used to identify %%scopes^scope%% and/or group %%terms|term%%, and that satisfies the regex `#[a-z-0-9]+`. As an %%identifier|identifier%% for a %%scope|scope%%, it can be used to disambiguate meanings. For example `#essif-lab:term` is an %%identifier|identifier%% for the %%concept|concept%% that within the %%scope|scope%% of eSSIF-Lab is referred to by the %%term|term%% 'Term'. In other situations, it may be used in combination with texts that document e.g. %%concepts|concept%%, so as to enable tools to group such texts.

### Criteria
