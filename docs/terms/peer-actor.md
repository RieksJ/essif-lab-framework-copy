### Short Description
The **peer actor** of some other [actor](@) in a [communication session](@) is the actor with whom/which this other actor is communicating in that session. In other words: it is the actor 'at the other side' of the [communication channel](@) that these actors use to exchange messages in.

### Purpose
From the perspective of an [actor](@) that has a [communication session](@) with an other actor, we need a term to refer to this other actor that is being communicated with.
