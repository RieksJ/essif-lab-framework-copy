### Short Description
An **assessment framework** is the combination of criteria that an auditor can evaluate by applying them to an %%entity|entity%% (of a specific kind), and the procedures that this auditor will follow for doing so, for the purpose of establishing the extent in which that %%entity|entity%% conforms to a stated set of requirements. Thus, an %%entity|entity%% can be assessed against an assessment framework.

An %%assessment framework|assessment-framework%% serves a specific purpose, e.g. a risk assessment framework serves to identify, analyse and evaluate %%risks|risk%% for the purpose of selecting and implementing appropriate ways to treat such %%risks|risk%%. Other frameworks may serve to assess the %%compliance|compliance%% e.g. with a %%normative framework|normative-framework%%.

Assessing an %%entity|entity%% against an %%assessment framework|assessment-framework%% means that all criteria are evaluated, and each of them is assigned a particular value, the syntax and semantics of which are defined in the %%assessment framework|assessment-framework%%. For example, an %%assessment framework|assessment-framework%% used in %%risk management|risk-management%% may define %%risk levels|risk-level%%. Similarly, a %%framework|assessment-framework%% for %%compliance|compliance%% may define %%compliance levels|compliance-level%% Obviously, the kinds of values that may result from such an assessment should be relevant for the purpose that the assement-framework serves.

An %%assessment framework|assessment-framework%% also typically provides principles, ideas, rules, working instructions (%%policies|policy%%) to provide some high-level guidance for the execution of actual assessments.

An %%assessment framework|assessment-framework%% may however also provide concrete, practical guidance for doing actual assessments. This can come e.g. in the form of procedures that are to be followed, checklists, reporting templates, etc.

### Purpose
The purpose of an **assessment framework** is to
- enable %%parties|party%% to determine the usefulness of having (sets of) %%entities|entity%% assessed against that framework, i.e. whether or not the expected results serves a purpose, i.e. realizes an %%objective|objective%% that the %%party|party%% pursues, and
- enable auditors to actually execute an assessment on a particular (set of) %%entities|entity%%, thereby producing (tangible) results that can be used to determine the extent in which these %%entities|entity%% conform to a stated set of requirements.
