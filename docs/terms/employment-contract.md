# Employment Contract

### Short Description

An **employment contract** is an agreement/contract between two [parties](@), one of which controls a set of [actors](@) (the [subjects](@) of the contract), that states (or refers to) all (sets of) rights and duties under which these [actors](@) can and/or must work for the other [party](@). This includes rights and duties of both [parties](@), as well as rights and duties of the [actor(s)](@) that are the [subject](@) of the contract.

Rights and duties pertain to e.g., (groups of) [actions](@) that the [actor(s)](@) are expected (not) to execute, which [policies](@) they would be expected (not) to follow, the conditions under which the [actor(s)](@) should work (e.g. times, locations, ...), the provisioning of any means needed to perform, etc. And of course, the contract would also state how the [party](@) that controls these [actors](@) will be remunerated.

The creation of [employment contracts](employment-contract@) are part of what is called [onboarding](@) (of an [actor](@), that is a [subject](@) of the [employment contract](@), by the [party](@) that wants to deploy the [actor](@) as one of its [agents](@). More details are given in the [party actor action pattern](party-actor-action@).

### Examples

An [individual](human-being@) may sign a labor contract, that allows it to work for an [organization](@) in a designated function, for which it receives a salary. The [individual](human-being@) and the [organization](@), which both qualify as [parties](@), sign the contract, which states the conditions under which the [individual](human-being@) (as an [actor](@)) works for the [organization](@). The function represents the kinds of [actions](@) that it would be executing, and there would be a section on working hours/locations, etc.

An [individual](human-being@) that is an [employee](@) for an employment agency would have a similar contract with that agency that provides it with a measure of control over the [individual](human-being@) that enables it to negotiate employment contracts with other [organizations](@). The [actor](@) (subject) of such an employment contract is the [individual](human-being@), and the other [organization](@) and the employment agency are the [parties](@) that sign the [employment contract](@).

Accountants that are [employed](employee@) by an accountancy firm have a contract with the accountancy firm stating the conditions (rights and duties of either) under which they work for that firm. When the firm receives an order from some [organization](@) for an accountancy job, it can then assign the accountant to that job. However, while this accountant may work at the premises of the [organization](@), the latter will not have [onboarded](onboarding@)

The [Parties, Actors and Actions pattern](party-actor-action@) describes how this concept fits in with related concepts.

### Purpose

The purpose of having [employment contracts](employment-contract@) is to ensure that [expectations](@) that [parties](@) have towards one another, and towards [actors](@) that work for them, are matched by corresponding [obligations](@) of the reciprocal [party](@) (for details on matching, see the section **[Matching](pattern:governance-and-management#matching)** of the [Governance and Management pattern](pattern:governance-and-management@)). An [employment contract](@) that is made explicit, and electronically available, may also serve as part of the chain of assets that are needed to determine the right (or duty) of an [actor](@) to execute an [action](@) on behalf of some [party](@).
### Criteria

An [employment contract](@) is an agreement/contract
- between two [parties](@), one of which controls a set of [actors](@) (the [subjects](@) of the contract);
- that states (or refers to) all (sets of) rights and duties under which these [actors](@) can and/or must work for the other [party](@);
- that includes rights and duties of both [parties](@), as well as rights and duties of the [actor(s)](@) that are the [subject](@) of the contract.
