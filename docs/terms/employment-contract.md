### Short Description

An **employment contract** is an agreement/contract between two %%parties|party%%, one of which controls a set of %%actors|actor%% (the %%subjects|subject%% of the contract), that states (or refers to) all (sets of) conditions under which these %%actors|actor%% can and/or must work for the other %%party|party%%. This includes, e.g., what the %%actor(s)|actor%% is/are expected to do, what they should refrain from doing, any timeslots, locations, etc., in which %%actions|action%% may (not) be executed, and so on. The %%employment contract|employment-contract%% states the the conditions under which its subjects have a duty to serve as an %%agent|agent%% for that %%party|party%%. And of course, the contract would also state how the %%party|party%% that contols these %%actors|actor%% will be remunerated.

The creation of %%employment contracts|employment-contract%% are part of what is called %%onboarding|onboarding%% (of an %%actor|actor%%, that is a %%subject|subject%% of the %%employment contract|employment-contract%%, by the %%party|party%% that wants to deploy the %%actor|actor%% as one of its %%agents|agent%%. More details are given in the %%party actor action pattern|pattern-party-actor-action%%.

### Examples

An %%individual|human-being%% may sign a labor contract, that allows it to work for an %%organization|organization%% in a designated function, for which it receives a salary. The %%individual|human-being%% and the %%organization|organization%%, which both qualify as %%parties|party%%, sign the contract, which states the conditions under which the %%individual|human-being%% (as an %%actor|actor%%) works for the %%organization|organization%%. The function represents the kinds of %%actions|action%% that it would be executing, and there would be a section on working hours/locations, etc.

An %%individual|human-being%% that is an %%employee|employee%% for an employment agency would have a similar contract with that agency that provides it with a measure of control over the %%individual|human-being%% that entables it to negotiate employment contracts with other %%organizations|organization%%. The %%actor|actor%% (subject) of such an employment contract is the %%individual|human-being%%, and the other %%organization|organization%% and the employment agency are the %%parties|party%% that sign the %%employment contract|employment-contract%%.

Accountants that are %%employed|employee%% by an accountancy firm have a contract with the accountancy firm stating the conditions (rights and duties of either) under which they work for that firm. When the firm receives an order from some %%organization|organization%% for an accountancy job, it can then assign the accountant to that job. However, while this accountant may work at the premises of the %%organization|organization%%, the latter will not have %%onboarded|onboarding%%


The %%Parties, Actors and Actions pattern|pattern-party-actor-action%% describes how this concept fits in with related concepts.
