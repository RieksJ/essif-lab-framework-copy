### Short Description
A **Normative framework** is a set of rules that are followed and/or criteria that remain fulfilled by (a specific kind of) %%entities|entity%% whose behavior and/or properties are characterized as 'normal'. Equivalently, one might say that abiding by the rules in an applicable %%normative framework|normative-framework%% is what constitutes normal behavior, and that having properties as specified by an applicable %%normative framework|normative-framework%% is what normally, %%entities|entity%% would have.

%%Normative frameworks|normative-framework%% may describe 'normal' behavior and properties, but a set of rules may also be defined as being a %%normative framework|normative-framework%%, in which case %%compliance|compliance%% with that %%normative framework|normative-framework%% is 'the norm'. Laws, rules, policies etc. that are part of (the %%legal system|legal-system%% of) a %%jurisdiction|jurisdiction%% are typical examples. Also, standards such as ISO 9001 or ISO 27001 can be designated as %%normative frameworks|normative-framework%% for organizations that want to have a good quality management system or information security management system respectively.

Normative frameworks may also come with be associated with %%assessment frameworks|assessment-framework%% that enable (independent) auditors to establish whether or not an %%entity|entity%% is %%compliant|compliance%%, and issue a certificate (e.g. in the form of a credential, or otherwise) stating such %%compliance|compliance%%.

### Purpose
A **Normative framework** may serve for the purpose of describing what the normal behavior and/or characteristics of an %%entity|entity%% (e.g. a %%party|party%%, or an %%actor|actor%%) are. Certificates (perhaps in the form of a credential) may be issued that state %%compliance|compliance%% of such an %%entity|entity%% with the %%normative framework|normative-framework%%

### Criterion
A **Normative framework** is a %%party|party%%,
- that consists of at least two different %%parties|party%% (its members);
- that sets %%objectives|objective%% for realizing results that enable its members to achieve their individual %%objectives|objective%% more efficiently and/or effectively;
- whose members contribute to the realization of these %%objectives|objective%%.
