# Normative framework


### Short Description

A **Normative framework** is a set of rules that are followed and/or criteria that remain fulfilled by (a specific kind of) [entities](@) whose behavior and/or properties are characterized as 'normal'. Equivalently, one might say that abiding by the rules in an applicable [normative framework](@) is what constitutes normal behavior, and that having properties as specified by an applicable [normative framework](@) is what normally, [entities](@) would have.

[Normative frameworks](normative-framework@) may describe 'normal' behavior and properties, but a set of rules may also be defined as being a [normative framework](@), in which case [compliance](@) with that [normative framework](@) is 'the norm'. Laws, rules, policies etc. that are part of (the [legal system](@) of) a [jurisdiction](@) are typical examples. Also, standards such as ISO 9001 or ISO 27001 can be designated as [normative frameworks](normative-framework@) for organizations that want to have a good quality management system or information security management system respectively.

Normative frameworks may also come with be associated with [assessment frameworks](assessment-framework@) that enable (independent) auditors to establish whether or not an [entity](@) is [compliant](compliance@), and issue a certificate (e.g. in the form of a credential, or otherwise) stating such [compliance](@).

### Purpose

A **Normative framework** may serve for the purpose of describing what the normal behavior and/or characteristics of an [entity](@) (e.g. a [party](@), or an [actor](@)) are. Certificates (perhaps in the form of a credential) may be issued that state [compliance](@) of such an [entity](@) with the [normative framework](@)

### Criterion

A **Normative framework** is a [party](@),
- that consists of at least two different [parties](@) (its members);
- that sets [objectives](@) for realizing results that enable its members to achieve their individual [objectives](@) more efficiently and/or effectively;
- whose members contribute to the realization of these [objectives](@).
