### Short Description
A **Normative framework** is a set of rules that are followed and/or criteria that remain fulfilled by (a specific kind of) %%entities|entity%% whose behaviour and/or properties are characterized as 'normal'. Equivalently, one might say that abiding by the rules in an applicable normative framework is what constitutes normal behaviour, and that having properties as specified by an applicable normative framework is what normally, %%entities|entity%% would have.

Normative frameworks may describe 'normal' behaviour and properties, but a set of rules may also be defined as being a normative framework, in which case %%compliance|compliance%% with that framework is 'the norm'. Laws, rules, policies etc. that are part of (the %%legal system|legal-system%% of) a %%jurisdiction|jurisdiction%% are typical examples. Also, standards such as ISO 9001 or ISO 27001 can be designated as normative frameworks for organizations that want to have a good quality management system or information security management system respectively.

Normative frameworks may also come with be associated with %%assessment frameworks|assessment-framework%% that enable (independent) auditors to establish whether or not an %%entity|entity%% is %%compliant|compliance%%, and issue a certificate (e.g. in the form of a credential, or otherwise) stating such %%compliance|compliance%%.

### Purpose
A **Normative framework** may serve for the purpose of describing what the normal behaviour and/or characteristics of an %%entity|entity%% (e.g. a %%party|party%%, or an %%actor|actor%%) are. Certificates (perhaps in the form of a credential) may be issued that state %%compliance|compliance%% of such an %%entity|entity%% with the normative framework

### Criterion
A **Normative framework** is a %%party|party%%,
- that consists of at least two different %%parties|party%% (its members);
- that sets %%objectives|objective%% for realizing results that enable its members to achieve their individual %%objectives|objective%% more efficiently and/or effectively;
- whose members contribute to the realization of these %%objectives|objective%%.
