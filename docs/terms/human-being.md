### Short Description

A **Human Being** is a person of flesh and blood (homo sapiens), each of which qualifies as:
- a [party](@), because it sets its [objectives](@), maintains its [knowledge](@), and uses that [knowledge](@) to pursue its [objectives](@) in an autonomous (sovereign) manner;
- an [actor](@), as it is an [entity](@) that can act (do things);
- a [jurisdiction](@), as it has a (non-empty) set of [objectives](@), one [scope](@) (i.e. its [own](ownership@) body and [knowledge](@)), one [legal system](@) (i.e. the moral and ethical rules it has adopted for guiding its behavior) and one [party](@) (i.e. itself) that operates this [legal system](@) within itself.

In our [framework](@), we assume that [humans](human-being@) [owns](@) themselves (especially in their personal [jurisdiction](@)). However, we recognize that whether or not a [person](human-being@) decides to [owns](@) itself lies in the autonomy of that [person](human-being@). So it may happen that a [person](human-being@) chooses to (willingly or forced) relinquish this [ownership](@) to another [party](@) (which one might call 'slavery').

### Purpose

The purpose of of defining the human being is that it allows us to document that it also qualifies as a [party](@), an [actor](@) and a [jurisdiction](@).

### Criteria

A **Human Being** is a person of flesh and blood (homo sapiens).

### Notes

Various contexts have related notions:
- **natural person** is a human being that - in a legal sense - holds rights and duties, and that can sue and be sued.
- **legal person** is a non-human [entity](@) that - in a legal sense - holds rights and duties, that can sue and be sued, and hence (legally) treated in a similar fashion as a natural person.
