### Short Description
A **risk owner** is the %%party|party%% that is the %%owner|owner%% of the %%objective|objective%% to which the %%risk|risk%% is associated.

The %%owner|owner%% of a %%risk|risk%% that is associated with an %%objective|objective%% must be the %%party|party%% that %%owns|owner%% that %%objective|objective%%, and vice versa, because %%ownership|ownership%% implies the %%authority|authority%% (rights and duties) to realize the %%objective|objective%%, which in turn implies the %%authority|authority%% to %%manage|management%% the associated %%risks|risk%%. Of course, as all %%owners|owner%% are %%parties|party%%, a %%risk owner|risk-owner%% may %%mandate|mandate%% %%actors|actor%% to execute the %%actions|action%% that are necessary to %%manage|management%% a %%risk|risk%%, but that does not relieve the %%party|party%% from its ownership (and facing possibly associated consequences). In fact, the objective of %%mandating|mandate%% %%risk management|risk-management%% activities may come with %%risks|risk%% which are often overlooked.

Networked Risk Management (reference needed) exploits the fact that the owner of a %%risk|risk%% and the owner of the associated %%objective|objective%% are one and the same %%party|party%%, the fact that in %%human beings|human-being%% are often not aware of the %%risks|risk%% they run, and the observation that important %%risks|risk%% often manifest themselves in feelings of insecurity or anxiety/tension, abdominal pain, sleepless nights, or other types of physical discomfort (the degree of which can be seen as the associated %%risk level|risk-level%%). Noticing that a %%person|human-being%% shows signals of physical discomfort can be used as a trigger for an %%activity|action%%, the result of which is that the associated %%objective|objective%% is identified (and made explicit), so that it can be analyzed, evaluated and treated (see %%risk-management|risk-management%%).

### Purpose
Knowing who %%owns|owner%% a %%risk|risk%% is knowing who is accountable when something goes wrong. When the associated %%objective|objective%% is also identified, the %%risk|risk%% can subsequently be %%managed|risk-management%%.

### Formalization

In the context of the eSSIF-Lab %%framework|framework%% (way of thinking), the definition can be explained by observing that there is an %%ownership|ownership%% relation between the %%party|party%% and the %%risk|risk%% that is associated with any %%objective|objective%% that it %%owns|owner%%. Determining that such a relation exists can be verified by applying its %%definition|definition%%, and observing that:
  - the %%party|party%% is a %%jurisdiction|jurisdiction%% (as explained %%here|objective%%),
  - both the %%party|party%% itself and the %%risk|risk%% are known to that %%party|party%% and hence qualify as %%legal entities|legal-entity%% for that %%jurisdiction|jurisdiction%%;
  - %%parties|party%% (un)consciously create, maintain and enforce rules (%%policies|policy%%) for identifying, assessing and treating uncertainties in (the effects of) their %%objectives|objective%% - which are the %%risks|risk%% associated with such %%objectives|objective%%, which is equivalent with saying that within their %%jurisdiction|jurisdiction%%, the %%legal system|legal-system%% (a) defines their rights and duties "to enjoy, dispose of and control" these %%risks|risk%%, (b) enforces them - i.e. %%manage|management%% them, and (c) provides a means to settle disputes - i.e. determine which of the various ways to control or treat risks must be followed.
