# Expectation

import useBaseUrl from '@docusaurus/useBaseUrl'

### Short Description

An **Expectation** is an [objective](@) that is [owned](@) by a [party](@) for having a specific (set of) result(s) produced, where the actual production thereof is (going to be) outsourced to another [party](@).

In the figure below, [objectives](@) Obj-1b.1 and Obj-1b.3 are [expectations](@) of Red towards Blue and Green respectively. Also, [objective](@) Obj-Yel-m is an [expectation](@) of Yellow towards Red.

</p>

The figure shows four [parties](@) (Red, Yellow, Blue and Green) and their associated [scopes of control](scope-of-control@). Within these, they [owns](@) the [objectives](@) (the figure shows 6 [objectives](@) owned by red and one for each of the other [parties](@)). The figure in the top right hand corner of the rectangle that represents an [objective](@), is the [party](@) that the [owner](@) of the [objective](@) expects to produce the [objective's](@) results. It is not necessary that such a [party](@) is known all the time (e.g. [objective](@) Obj-1a).

The arrows indicate that results produced to realize a certain [objective](@) (at the source of the arrow) are (to be) used to produce the results of another [objective](@) (at the end/tip of the arrow).

For more information, e.g. about how different [parties](@) interact in their roles of producer and consumer, we refer you to the [Governance and Management pattern](pattern-governance-and-management@).
