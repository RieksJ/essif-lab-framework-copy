## Short Description
An **Action** is something that is actually done/executed by a %%actor|actor%% in some context (i.e. in a specific place, at a specific time). During the time interval in which the action is executed, the actor may still execute other actions in other execution-contexts (multi-tasking). An action is executed for, or on behalf of, a specific %%party|party%%, which means that the primary guidance for executing the action, e.g. how to execute it, boundary conditions within which the execution must take place, etc., comes from the %%knowledge|knowledge%% of that party. The actor is assumed to have appropriate access to the knowledge of that party. In order to properly execute the action, the executing actor may also use additional knowledge(s) to which it has access.

## Purpose
The ability to distinguish between (non)actions allows one to determine which (kinds of) %%actors|actor%% are capable of executing actions (e.g. by establishing that they have the competences required by the party), and as a consequence may be permitted and/or required to execute them. Also, this ability enables parties to determine the execution-policy, i.e. the set of rules and other guidance that actors should obey or comply with when exeucting an action on its behalf.

## Criterion:
An **Action** is something that is done by an actor, can be considered a single operation, and is performed in a specific context, for or on behalf of a specific party, i.e. in accordance with the policy rules that this party has established for such actions.

## Examples:
- filling in a form and submitting it.
- cleaning a car.
