:::caution
The entire section on Terminology Engine v 2 (TEv2) is still under construction
:::

TEv2 assumes that the [curated|curate] data resides in an existing github repository (repo), and that [curated file] should be processeable by [Docusaurus v2](https://docusaurus.io/docs/docs-introduction), which is a static site generator for web sites that document all sorts of guidance, specifications, etc.

:::info Editor's note
This page needs texts that describe how curators can
- create a new github repo with a docusaurus intallation that works in combination with TEv2;
- convert their existing github repo so that it will work with TEv2 (which should include the necessary guidance regarding the installation of Docusaurus as well)
