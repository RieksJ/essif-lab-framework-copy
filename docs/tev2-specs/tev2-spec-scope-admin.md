:::caution
The entire section on Terminology Engine v 2 (TEv2) is still under construction
:::

This document specifies the contents of the Scope Administration file.

:::info Editor's note
The scope administration file contains whatever needs to be administered in the scope. For starters, that is the set of terms that, while part of the scope, refer to definitions that are defined in other scopes (possibly of other [terms communities|terms-community])
:::

## Requirements/backlog?

1. The scope administration file must support simple queries for bulk-importing terms from specific [scopes|scope], or groups of [scopes]
