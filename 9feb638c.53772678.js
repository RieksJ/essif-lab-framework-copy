Back in 2013, it was chaired by the CEO of KPN, the leading Dutch telecom operator. Being highly aware of cyber security and associated risks, KPN had a framework in place, and was certified against ISO 27001. In spite of all this, a 17-year old script-kiddie broke into IT systems of KPN in the beginning of February, which enabled him to intercept internet traffic and manipuate the telephone network to the extent that the emergency call number 112 could have been rendered out of service.

This case demonstrates that there is a difference between an organization having information security awareness at the top management level, having an information security management system in place, and being certified against ISO 27001, and on organization that effectively ensures that (in its 'operational cellars') security updates for (cruscial) software are actually installed.",Object(i.b)("a",Object(r.a)({parentName:"li"},{href:"#fnref-1",className:"footnote-backref"}),"\u21a9")))))}l.isMDXComponent=!0},253:function(e,t,a){"use strict";var r=a(0),n=a(20);t.a=function(){var e=Object(r.useContext)(n.a);if(null===e)throw new Error("Docusaurus context not provided");return e}},254:function(e,t,a){"use strict";a.d(t,"b",(function(){return i})),a.d(t,"a",(function(){return s}));var r=a(253),n=a(255);function i(){var e=Object(r.a)().siteConfig,t=(e=void 0===e?{}:e).baseUrl,a=void 0===t?"/":t,i=e.url;return{withBaseUrl:function(e,t){return function(e,t,a,r){var i=void 0===r?{}:r,s=i.forcePrependBaseUrl,o=void 0!==s&&s,c=i.absolute,h=void 0!==c&&c;if(!a)return a;if(a.startsWith("#"))return a;if(Object(n.b)(a))return a;if(o)return t+a;var m=a.startsWith(t)?a:t+a.replace(/^\//,"");return h?e+m:m}(i,a,e,t)}}}function s(e,t){return void 0===t&&(t={}),(0,i().withBaseUrl)(e,t)}},255:function(e,t,a){"use strict";function r(e){return!0===/^(\w*:|\/\/)/.test(e)}function n(e){return void 0!==e&&!r(e)}a.d(t,"b",(function(){return r})),a.d(t,"a",(function(){return n}))}}]);
