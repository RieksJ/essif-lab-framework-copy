Doing so implicitly specifies the kinds of data that the form will ask for. Secondly, the provider must decide for each of the data it receives, whether or not it is valid to be used in that argument - the process of deciding this is called 'validation'. Common criteria that help to make this distinction include whether or not the data is presented in the expected format, whether or not it is true (not so easy), whether it is not outdated, or whether or not it satisfies validation rules (in the example, the municipality may require that the specified license plate belongs to a car owned by the person that requests the permit).
